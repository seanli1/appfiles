#Find out how to use the apple boxes in your stash to get to an exact height.
#
#1. Enter the boxes you have available to use.
#
#2. Select which orientations work for you. In some cases, you can use the taller orientation, and in other cases, you want them all to be flat for the best stability. You get to choose what’s best for your situation.
#
#3. Pick the height you’re aiming for. If an exact match isn’t possible given what you’ve entered, you’ll still get the closest solution. Just order more boxes next time. 😉
