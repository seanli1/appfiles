		<question>How can I purchase savings bonds?</question>
		<answer>The U.S. Treasury Department is converting from issuing paper bonds to issuing bonds electronically and the process of purchasing savings bonds by payroll deduction for Federal employees and military members will soon end. To start or continue purchasing savings bonds, you will need to establish an individual account at Treasury Direct Website. 
After you establish your account at Treasury Direct Website, use myPay to establish an allotment to your account at Treasury Direct for purchase of savings bonds. Information on establishing a TreasuryDirect account is available at Treasury Direct Website; view the link about how to buy using Treasury Direct payroll savings. 
View the Treasury Direct FAQs about the elimination of paper bonds via payroll savings. 
For military members with current bond allotments, DFAS will automatically stop your bond allotment at the end of July. However, if you have a multi-month bond (purchase requires more than one month's deduction) that can be fully purchased by the end of August, it will be allowed to continue until that date and then the allotment will be stopped. For civilian employees, payroll deduction for bonds will stop as of 29 August 2010.
For both military and civilian employees, you will be refunded any amount that was deducted but not used to purchase a bond. In addition, you'll see an increase in your net pay as a result of discontinuing the bond allotment. 
For active duty members with bonds held in safekeeping by DFAS, they will remain in safekeeping until you leave active duty or until you request release of the bonds.

		<question>Why is my BAH different from someone at my duty location who has the same rank as I do?</question>
		<answer>If you are receiving a different BAH allowance than someone from the same duty location that has the same rank as you, BAH Rate Protection is probably in effect for one of you.  The monthly BAH amount must not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the MHA (Military Housing Area), changes in the national monthly housing cost, or a member's promotion.  One of you is most likely receiving a higher BAH in an area where there was a BAH reduction.  This grandfathering protects the member from BAH fluctuations.
To check the rate of BAH for your PDS (Note, BAH is based on your PDS Zip Code, not your home Zip Code) and rank, please visit DTMO's BAH Rates web site.
However, if you believe this is not the case (i.e. the rate in your area did not decrease and you are not subject to BAH Rate Protection), then you should immediately contact your servicing Finance Office to ensure you are not over or under paid.

		<question>How can I get copies of old travel vouchers?</question>
		<answer>For vouchers that were created and processed electronically through the Defense Travel System (DTS), you can view and print your paid travel vouchers by accessing DTS.
For non-DTS vouchers such as PCS and most deployment travel, when the voucher is paid, a copy is emailed to you at the address on file in the Reserve Travel System (RTS). If you didn't get a copy, it could be that an incorrect email address is on file in RTS or there could have been a delay in processing your voucher. You should contact your servicing Finance Office for assistance and to check your RTS email address. 
If you are looking for a voucher filed at a different duty location, you should contact that base for help in retrieving old voucher copies.  You can use our FSO Look-up Tool to find the contact information for the FSO at different locations.
Please note that the statute of limitations on travel voucher retention by the FSO is 6 years and 3 months.  It is unlikely you will be able to retrieve voucher copies beyond that time frame, so therefore it is important to always save a digital or hard copy of all filed travel vouchers in your personal records.

		<question>How will I get paid as a new reservist?</question>
		<answer>Effective 1 September 1989, participation in the direct deposit program became mandatory for all new Air Force active duty, ANG, Air Reserve members, and those members reenlisting or gaining officer status after that date. If the member is not enrolled in the Direct Deposit of Pay Program, DFAS-DE prepares and mails checks to member’s personal mailing address. Waivers for non-participation in the Direct Deposit of Pay Program may be granted by the unit and/or installation commander. Waivers may be granted upon an individual’s request, or may be commander-directed due to circumstances in which participation in the Direct Deposit of Pay Program is not feasible or practical. A waiver issued by the unit commander at the member’s request may not exceed six months. A waiver of greater than six months must be approved by the unit’s higher headquarters or the installation commander, whichever is applicable. The Direct Deposit of Pay Waiver Report, UH022-302, is sent monthly to each unit to identify non-participation and whether a waiver has been approved and if so, when it expires.</answer>

		<question>Why didn't I receive full Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) on the first and last day of my TDY?</question>
		<answer>Full per diem is not authorized on the first or last day of TDY. When TDY, regardless of the meal rate authorized in your orders, you are only authorized 75% of the appropriate M&IE rate on the day of your departure from PDS, and on the day of return to your PDS.

The appropriate M&IE rate in these instances will be the rate from your last TDY or authorized delay point. Any TDY en route locations, on the day travel ends, does not affect the M&IE rate for that return day unless overnight lodging is required.

		<question>Am I eligible for First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP) Dislocation Allowance (DLA)?</question>
		<answer>First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP) DLA is a category of partial DLA that exists for student pilots assigned to Air Education Training Command (AETC) locations.
This partial DLA is payable when a student completes training and remains at that station as their first assignment. Full DLA is not authorized because the student is not on PCS orders, but a short distance Household Goods (HHG) move may be authorized at the government's expense when the student moves from the training dorms to permanent party dorms or housing with orders.

		<question>Does updating my EFT information in myPay update the information in Travel Pay systems as well?</question>
		<answer>Currently the Air Force uses two travel pay systems: The Reserve Travel System (RTS) and the Defense Travel System (DTS).

For military members, unless you've previously designated a separate account for travel payments, updating your EFT information in myPay will automatically update your EFT information in RTS. However, it does not update your EFT information in DTS. To make this update, you must contact your Unit's Organizational Defense Travel Administrator (ODTA) for assistance.
To designate a separate account for travel payments for non-DTS travel (RTS), please use eFinance.
For Civilian personnel, updating your EFT information in myPay will not automatically update your EFT information in RTS. You need to contact your local Finance Office and complete a Standard Form 1199A (Direct Deposit Sign-Up) to have this information updated in RTS, and your unit ODTA to update DTS.

		<question>How can I challenge a civilian PCS debt?</question>
		<answer>If you do not agree with the amount or validity of the debt, you can contact your servicing Finance Office for an explanation of the voucher. A review and re-computation of the voucher will reveal if the debt is either correct or incorrect.

If the debt is incorrect, a supplemental voucher will need to be processed to make the correction.  Depending on the source of the error, you may need to prepare a supplemental voucher using DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub voucher.
   
If the debt is determined to be correct, you have the option of requesting a waiver of the debt from your Civilian Payroll Office.  In order to do that, a DD Form 139 will need to be prepared by the AFFSC and forwarded to Civilian Payroll to establish the debt on your pay record. At that point you can work with Civilian Payroll to process the waiver request. Waivers are forwarded to DFAS for review and adjudication.

		<question>How much leave do I earn as a reservist?</question>
		<answer>For active duty tours of 30 consecutive days or more, you accrue leave at the rate of one-half (1/2) calendar day for every 6 days on active duty in a pay status, with a maximum of two and one-half (2 1/2) calendar days for each 30 consecutive days, including allowable travel time. You do not accrue leave for periods of duty in a non-pay status or for tours less than 30 days.
If you are on back-to-back tours (no break in orders), leave will accrue and can be rolled over until the end of the back-to-back orders. Any leave not used during the confines of the last back-to-back order, must be sold back when that order ends.
Typically, the accrued leave must be used before the end of your active duty tour. For example, if you are on an active duty tour from 2 March through 30 April, your accrued leave must be taken before 1 May. Please see your Reserve Pay Office for exceptions to this rule.

If there is any unused accrued leave remaining at the end of your tour, it must be sold. Once your Reserve Pay Office receives your completed AF Form IMT 938 (Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour), they will process a transaction to generate payment of your remaining leave balance. Typically, the leave will be paid 10-16 days following input by your Reserve Pay Office. Contact your Reserve Pay Office regarding local policies concerning sell back requirements.
Check your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) via myPay for your current leave balance.
Note: Exceptions to the leave payment policy apply during contingency operations; please contact your Reserve Pay Office for details to your specific situation.

		<question>Can I be reimbursed for two different lodging receipts for the same day?</question>
		<answer>Yes, you may claim dual lodging to cover lodging expenses that arise because of unexpected circumstances beyond your control during TDY travel. Dual lodging must be approved after the fact by an amended authorization/order or by your AO on your travel voucher. The AO will verify that you acted reasonably and prudently in determining if it was necessary for you to obtain dual lodgings for other than personal convenience. Dual lodging reimbursement is limited to a maximum of 7 consecutive days through AO approval.  Dual lodging over 7 days must be approved by the Secretarial Process.

		<question>Am I allowed to bring dependents back if they leave early under early return of dependents (ERD) orders?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members: Yes; however, in most cases return of the dependent(s) will be at the member's expense.
Civilian Employees: Yes; however, once dependents travel on ERD orders certain limitations apply (see JTR Chap 5_Part_B_Sec_3c (Civilian Employees - Dependent Travel - Early Return of Dependents) for more information):
A dependent’s early return travel under Chapter 5 must not be authorized more than once during each period of OCONUS service
A dependent’s return travel at GOV’T expense to the OCONUS PDS is not authorized except when incident to the employee’s Renewal Agreement Travel (RAT). See par. 7065.
A dependent’s early return transportation expenses to the OCONUS PDS are reimbursable when an employee:

Completes an agreed to period of service
Has received unaccompanied one-way dependent transportation to the actual residence
Has RAT at a later date
Reimbursement must not exceed the GOV’T's cost for the usual transportation mode and route that would have been used had the dependent traveled back to the OCONUS PDS with the employee

		<question>How does hospitalization affect my tax free status?</question>
		<answer>If you are hospitalized, or rehospitalized, because of a wound, disease or injury that you incurred while serving in a combat zone, your tax free status (combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE)) continues while you are hospitalized.  Your exclusion ends when you are discharged from the hospital or changed to outpatient status.  If you are rehospitalized due to the same injury you may also qualify for the tax exclusion for up to two years after hostilities have ended.

		<question>My January LES shows Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) for December, why didn't I get my tax refunded?</question>
		<answer>When a retroactive transaction is processed that adjusts your prior year federal and state wages, a corrected W-2 will be issued to reflect the change in taxable wages. In this particular case, the adjustment reduced your taxable wages; however, because it is for a prior year, we cannot refund the taxes to you directly.  When you file the corrected W-2 with your tax return, the reduction of your taxable wages decreases your tax liability, and increases the amount of any refund that may be due to you.  If you need to request a corrected W-2, contact your servicing Finance Office for assistance.</answer>

		<answer>You may not have received it yet because the allowance is not paid until the end of your anniversary month. However, if it is projected that you will not remain on your current enlistment more than six months beyond your anniversary month, then the replacement Civilian Clothing Allowance is not authorized, and it will not be paid.

If you are assigned to a duty station or career field that qualifies for Civilian Clothing Allowance and you have received an annual replacement allowance before, but have yet to receive it this year, please contact your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>Why did my Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) stop working?</question>
		<answer>The three most common reasons that your card can not be used are:
Your card's limit has been reached
Your account is over 60 days delinquent and your Agency Program Coordinator (APC) suspended the card
Your card expired 
The card issuer's phone agents or your APC can give you the specifics of your situation and your APC can assist in correcting the issue.
If you are stranded while on official business, call the 1-800 number on the back of the GTCC and identify yourself as a stranded Department of Defense (DoD) traveler.

		<question>How do I request an additional travel advance for my civilian PCS?</question>
		<answer>The standard practice for receiving an advance is to use your Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) at an ATM machine.

If you do not have a GTCC, or you are a member of the collective bargaining unit not yet required to use a GTCC, then you will need to go to your Finance Office and request an advance paid via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). You will need to prepare a DD Form 1351-2 and submit through eFinance.  If you need more help with your Civilian PCS advance contact your Finance Office.

If you did receive an advance via EFT, the advance will be deducted when you file your PCS settlement travel voucher at your new duty station.

		<question>What are my dependents’ living expense allowances at a safe haven location incident to an authorized evacuation?</question>
		<answer>Safe haven evacuation allowances for your command-sponsored dependents are provided to assist meeting the excess costs involved in temporarily maintaining a separate residence for your dependents.
First 30 days:
Each dependent 12 years old or older (including your spouse) is authorized 100% of the per diem rate for meals & incidental expense (M&IE) and up to 100% of the lodging rate for the safe haven location.
Each dependent under 12 years old is authorized 50% of the per diem rate for M&IE and up to 50% of the lodging rate for the safe haven location.
Note: Lodging tax is reimbursed separately.
Example:  Spouse, a child over 12, and 2 children under 12 evacuate to a safe haven location with an M&IE rate of $46 and a max lodging rate of $77 per day. The spouse and the child over 12 are each authorized 100% of the M&IE rate ($46 x 100% x 2 = $92/day). The 2 children under 12 are each authorized 50% of the M&IE rate ($46 x 50% x 2 = $46/day). Lodging can be reimbursed for the entire family up to 300% (100% + 100% + 50% + 50% = 300%) of the max lodging rate per day (300% x $77 = $231/day).
Day 31 – 180
Each dependent 12 years old or older (including your spouse) is authorized 60% of the per diem rate for M&IE and up to 60% of the lodging rate for the safe haven location.
Each dependent under 12 years old is authorized 30% of the per diem rate for M&IE and up to 30% of the lodging rate for the safe haven location.

		<question>I paid the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) off, why didn't my pay check increase by $100?</question>
		<answer>While your $100 MGIB deduction is collecting from your pay, your monthly taxable wage is reduced by the same $100.  This results in less federal income tax being withheld from your pay.  When your MGIB is fully collected, your monthly taxable wage increases by $100, resulting in more federal income tax being withheld from your pay.  You will see the difference of the taxes withheld as in increase in your pay after the MGIB is fully collected. </answer>

		<question>What is earned income credit (EIC) and how do I apply for it?</question>
		<answer>EIC is a tax credit for certain people who work and whose earned income is less than the threshold established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The EIC may reduce your income tax liability at the end of the year and may give you a refund even if you don't owe any tax.

Eligibility for EIC can be determined by completing the worksheet on the back of the W-5 Form (Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate). If eligible, submit your completed W-5 to your Finance Office. Also, review the IRS Publication 596 at the link below.

Active Duty:
If you file the W-5 Form before the end of the tax year with your Finance Office you may receive advance payment of the EIC in your pay. When you file your tax return at the end of the year, you claim any advance payment of EIC that you received and determine if there is any remaining credit due you.

Reserve:
At the end of the tax year, claim the EIC when you file your tax return.

		<question>How do I claim a secondary dependent for Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)?</question>
		<answer>If you already have a primary dependent, then submitting paperwork for a secondary dependent has no impact on your BAH; however, you can still complete a dependency determination for other entitlements (ID card, medical, etc.).
If your secondary dependent is your sole dependent for BAH purposes (or you are completing a dependency determination for other entitlements), then the following applies:
To claim a secondary dependent you must complete AF Form 594 (Application and Authorization to start, stop or change BAQ or Dependency Re-determination). You must also complete the appropriate DD Form 137.
You may receive these forms and assistance in filling them out from your finance office.
Additionally, you must obtain supporting documents that establish the secondary dependent relationship and/or financial support. Written verification of the dependent's income, from all sources, is required. Accepted documents include, but are not limited to: pay stubs, Social Security documents and W-2s.  When the dependent does not reside in your household, then proof of your support is also required. Accepted documents include, but are not limited to: canceled checks, money orders, receipts or a dependent support allotment.
Due to a recent regulation change, you will personally send all documentation to DFAS for final determination.
Please see the Dependency Determinations pamphlet in the File Attachments below for detailed instructions regarding secondary dependents, as well as the current mailing address for DFAS submissions.

		<question>How do I update my Defense Travel System (DTS) profile?</question>
		<answer>It is important for travelers to ensure that Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), home address, and Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) information is current in their DTS profile.  If this information is not kept up to date, travel reimbursements may be affected.  In addition to the information above, travelers should periodically check their profiles in order to update other information such as rank, organization, phone number, emergency contact and other traveler information.

GTCC expires or is reissues
Moving/Permanent Change of Station (PCS)
Promotion/New Job
To update your profile in DTS:
From your DTS homepage (after login), mouse over to Traveler Setup on the top menu bar and select Update Personal Profile
On the My Profile screen, click on each section to verify your information (My Preferences, My Additional Information, My TSA Information, My Account Information)
Save changes, select the Update Personal Information button at the bottom of the screen

		<question>How do I rebut my debt for excess cost of household goods shipment?</question>
		<answer>You are typically notified of your debt by the Finance Office when they receive a DD Form 139 (Pay Authorization) for an excess cost indebtedness. To file for a rebuttal, you must generate a letter stating why you believe the amount that you've been asked to pay is incorrect. You also need to have a copy of the DD Form 139 (obtained from the Finance Office) as well as a copy of your PCS orders. Please submit all required documentation to the Traffic Management Office (TMO) within 30 days of receiving the debt notification.

You have 30 days from the date of notification of the Household Goods (HHG) indebtedness to file the rebuttal letter with the Transportation Management Office (TMO).  The counselor at TMO will review the letter for completeness and forward it to Joint Personal Property Shipping Office (JPPSO) in San Antonio for a decision.  Upon adjudication, JPPSO will notify you of their decision with either an adjusted DD Form 139 increasing/decreasing the debt, or a letter of cancellation of the debt.  The TMO will also be notified.
It can take several months before you receive notification of indebtedness for exceeding your household weight allowance. This delay is due to carrier billing procedures and the gathering of information by the excess cost adjudication function.

		<question>What options do I have for paying back my security deposit advance?</question>
		<answer>You may pay back your security deposit advance over a 12 month period, with minimum monthly payments of $50. If you are overseas and the amount of your security deposit advance is greater than $500, you may defer repayment of the advance until you vacate the quarters for which the advance was taken. This option serves to prevent financial hardship that may be caused by having to pay back a large housing advance payment which will, in all likelihood, be refunded when you move out.
Lump sum repayment to the government, of the amount you receive from your landlord upon vacating the quarters, is required. If you receive less than the full amount, taking exchange rate fluctuations into consideration, you may prorate the remaining balance due over up to 12 months. Each payment must be at least $50.

		<answer>A HFP/IDP debt is generated on your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) if the entitlement is not stopped in a timely manner, which results in an overpayment.
After you file your final travel voucher and a transaction is processed to stop the HFP/IDP, it is backdated to the day you were no longer entitled to HFP/IDP and this may create a debt.

		<question>What Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate do I receive when I PCS from OCONUS to CONUS?</question>
		<answer>Typically, while in PCS status returning from an OCONUS duty location, you will receive BAH Transit (BAH-T).
This rate will start the day you depart your OCONUS duty station and will continue until the day before you report to your new PDS.
For example, if you depart your OCONUS duty station on Saturday and report to your new PDS on Thursday, then you will receive BAH-T from Saturday through Wednesday.

If you were on an unaccompanied tour, then generally you will continue to receive the BAH rate based on the location of your dependents until the day before you arrive at your new PDS.
For current BAH-T rates go to Per Diem Rates

		<question>Can I get my Dislocation Allowance (DLA) in advance?</question>
		<answer>You are required to use your Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) to the greatest extent possible for all PCS related expenses. This includes expenses which are linked to the DLA.  

If the GTCC cannot be used to pay the expense directly, you should attempt to obtain the necessary funds from an ATM. If the ATM limits prevent obtaining enough cash, a bank teller can provide the advance if the card is presented. If none of the above methods to obtain the funds are prudent, the Finance Office can pay the DLA in advance by EFT to your account.  

If you are exempt from GTCC use, you may receive DLA in advance. Advance DLA will not be paid earlier than 10 days prior to departure.

To file a claim for DLA, please use eFinance.
For Reservists, your orders must state that PCS entitlements are authorized.

		<question>Can I keep incentives (tickets, airline credits, etc.) offered by an airline carrier for involuntarily being "bumped" from my flight?</question>
		<answer>No. You may not keep compensation offered by an airline for involuntarily relinquishing your seat on your scheduled flight while on travel under official TDY orders. You must request that the airline carrier make the compensation check payable to the "Treasurer of the United States" and turn in with your TDY travel voucher.
However, if you voluntarily relinquish your seat, you may keep any compensation offered, provided it does not result in any additional travel costs (i.e. per diem, lodging, reimbursable) to the government. Any additional travel expenses incurred as a result of voluntarily giving up your seat are your financial responsibility.

		<question>How often can I receive a civilian clothing allowance?</question>
		<answer>If you receive a civilian clothing allowance as a result of a PCS (to a qualifying location), you are entitled to a civilian clothing allowance every 36 months. If authorized by your commander, you will receive an annual replacement payment in addition to this allowance.
Officers are authorized a civilian clothing allowance only if his/her PDS is outside of the United States.

If you receive civilian clothing allowance for a TDY, you must be TDY for 15 days in a 30 day period, or 30 days total in a 36 month period to receive the allowance. TDYs do not have to be served consecutively. Only one civilian clothing allowance is payable in any 36 month period. This applies to both officers and enlisted personnel (exceptions may apply).

		<question>What is the $600 Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) Buy-Up (Kicker) Program?</question>
		<answer>This is an additional contribution to the GI Bill that allows the service member to receive increased monthly education benefits. 
Like the $1200 paid for the MGIB, the additional contribution of up to $600 is non-refundable, and it will not affect your taxable income since it is not a reduction of your entitlements.  The education office will verify your eligibility. 
You do not have to pay the $600 additional MGIB contribution all at once.  You can contribute any amount up to the $600 maximum via payroll deduction (preferred), cash, or check. You may elect to contribute the whole lump sum, partial lump sums, or you may elect to pay the Kicker in increments as low as $20 per payroll deduction.  You can start and stop contributions as you wish.
Your education benefits are based on how much you contribute.  For the additional $600, you may receive up to $5,400 in additional GI Bill benefits.
Once your eligibility for the additional $600 MGIB contribution Buy-Up (Kicker) has been verified by your Education Office, you will need to bring a completed DD Form 2366 (MGIB General Instructions) to your local Finance Office to either initiate payroll deduction, make a lump sum payment or a partial payment via check, cashiers check or money order.
For more information on the MGIB and Post 9/11 GI Bill, access the VA web site at Veterans Affairs GI Bill Website or contact your local Education Assistance Office.

		<question>Can I pre certify my Annual Tour (AT)?</question>
		<answer>Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA) on Active Duty tours less than 30 days may have their tour processed in advance, but the tour payment will not be paid until the appropriate scheduled date. 

Reservists on annual training tours or special training tours can qualify for advance certification of payment, if there are at least ten members performing as one unit and the tour length is at least 12 days or more.

Any exception to this must be authorized by HQ Air Force Reserves.

		<question>As a civil service employee, what are my dependents’ living expense allowances at a safe haven location incident to an authorized evacuation?</question>
		<answer>Safe haven evacuation allowances are referred to as Subsistence Expense Allowances (SEA) for your authorized civilian dependents and are provided help offset direct added expenses that are incurred by your family as a result of an evacuation order. Your dependents can choose to be reimbursed for their expenses either via commercial or non-commercial rate SEA. The primary difference between the two rates is the lodging reimbursement and required receipts; commercial rate SEA requires a commercial lodging receipt, whereas the non-commercial rate SEA does not, but the amount of reimbursement for lodging is drastically reduced.
Commercial Rate
First 30 days:
First evacuee is authorized up to 100% of the lodging portion plus a flat amount equal to 100% of the meals & incidental expense (M&IE) of the safe haven per diem rate.
For each evacuee age 18 or older, a flat amount equal to 100% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.
For each evacuee under 18, a flat amount equal to 50% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.
Note: based on the gender and age of the additional evacuees, a higher lodging entitlement (up to 150%) is authorized. See JTR Chap 6 Part B Sec 3c Para 632 (Civilian Employees - Payments During an Ordered-Authorized Departure From a Foreign Area) for details.
Day 31-180:
First evacuee is authorized up to 80% of the lodging portion plus a flat amount equal to 80% of M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.
For each evacuee age 18 or older, a flat amount equal to 80% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.
For each evacuee under 18, a flat amount equal to 40% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.
Non-commercial rate SEA is computed the same as the commercial rate for the M&IE portion. Lodging portion of the SEA is only paid to the first evacuee at a rate of 10% of the lodging portion of the safe haven per diem rate, and only during the first 30 days.

		<question>I’m a new Cadet, how do I pay for initial items I need to purchase?</question>
		<answer>All Air Force Cadets receive advance pay for computer, initial uniforms, and first semester books when first arriving at the Academy. The money goes into a separate account and then is repaid back over the next 18-24 months as a repay deduction from your base pay. Future purchases are processed and taken directly from your base pay (Pay As You Go). The exception is book money, which is included in your net pay, and you will have to budget for your future book purchases.</answer>

		<question>How much Hostile Fire Pay / Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) am I entitled to receive?</question>
		<answer>Currently, HFP/IDP is $225 per month.
Remember that HFP/IDP, while often referred as the same entitlement, are separate entitlements with differing qualifying criteria.
If you're entitled to Hostile Fire Pay (HFP), you will receive the full amount for the month of entitlement. 
A legislative change that was effective 31 December 2011, requires that Imminent Danger Pay be paid on a prorated basis.  That means if you're performing duty in the designated Imminent Danger Pay (IDP) area for less than a full month, you'll receive IDP prorated on a daily basis for the number of days you're in the IDP area. 
For updates or changes to HFP/IDP rates, please see the Military Pay Tables on the DFAS website, select the year the entitlement was earned, and look for the Incentive and Special Pays section of the Pay Table.  For more info, please visit the DFAS Website.

		<question>How much CONUS/OCONUS Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) do I get?</question>

		<question>What are Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA) and Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA)?</question>
		<answer>Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) is an entitlement established to reimburse employees substantially all of the Federal, State, and local income taxes incurred because of reimbursements made on a PCS move.  The RITA entitlement is a two-year process and consists of two allowances -- the Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA) and the RITA payment.

WTA is an estimated payment of the final RITA payment and is payable only if you elect to receive it.  It is paid on each taxable claim that you have in conjunction with your PCS move and is intended as an immediate offset to the taxes withheld on your claims.  The WTA payment itself is subject to withholding.  The WTA allows you to receive the same reimbursement on your claims had withholding not been required. If you receive a WTA payment, it is mandatory that you file a RITA claim within 120 days after the new calendar year.

RITA payments are made in the calendar year following the calendar year in which the WTA was paid.  It is designed to compensate you for the additional tax liability incurred as a result of your government funded move. You must file a claim for your RITA, it is not automatic. The RITA will reconcile your WTA payments with your personal tax liability.

Your FSO will assist you in filing your RITA claim.
To further help you answer PCS questions, HQ AFPC/DPKD has published a guide for Civilian Permanent Change of Station Moves CONUS to CONUS and CONUS to Non-Foreign Overseas and Return (dated 7 Apr 2006) which can be found on the AFPC website link below.

		<question>What happens to my family separation allowance, type R (FSA-R) if my dependents come to visit</question>
		<answer>You are still entitled to FSA-R, as long as all of your dependents do not visit for longer than 3 months. The key is your dependents are truly just visiting and not reestablishing residence with you (FSA-R stops immediately if this is the case). If some dependents visit for longer than 3 months, you may be entitled to keep receiving FSA-R, if you're entitled for those dependents that are not visiting you.
If your FSA-R is stopped, either because the visit extended past 3 months or you dependents reestablish residency apart from you, you will be re-entitled to FSA-R effect the day they leave your permanent duty station.

		<question>If my money was not deposited into my new account, and if I already closed my previous account, how do I get my money?</question>
		<answer>For situations involving pay, banks will generally return the money to DFAS within three to five days. Once DFAS receives the funds they will deposit the funds back into your pay account. You should check with your old bank to ensure that it was returned to DFAS, and then follow up with your Finance Office to see if it is projected to be in your next paycheck.

For situations involving travel pay, once DFAS receives the funds back, they notify the Payment Office that made the original travel payment. The Payment Office will generate a supplemental travel payment to send the funds to the correct account.

In all cases, you should ensure that the appropriate changes were made so that future payments go to the correct account.

		<question>Do I have to pay back my bonus in a lump sum amount?</question>
		<answer>Generally, repayment of a bonus is necessary if you do not fulfill the service conditions or complete the term of service for which you were paid a bonus. Lump sum repayment will be requested and you can make your repayment by a check, money order, or cash at your Finance Office. Your debt letter should clearly outline repayment options and procedures.
Make your check payable to: US Treasury - DSSN 3801 and submit to your servicing Finance Office.

Reservist: Only submit your check to DFAS at the following address.
Disbursing Operations Directorate
3801 Center Collections
PO Box 269490
Indianapolis, IN 46249
If you cannot make a lump sum payment, an indebtedness will be established on your pay account with the intent of collecting the debt by your anticipated date of separation.  Repayment will not be less than $50 per month unless you have MAJCOM approval for an extended repayment up to 36 months.

		<question>Why did I get charged leave for my travel days during my TDY?</question>
		<answer>Normally, leave charged for travel days is the result of using your POV when it is not advantageous to the government.  Travel days are calculated as follows:
Uniformed Members:
You are limited to the constructive travel time for travel by common carrier (i.e. commercial air), usually 1 day each way, for travel to and from the TDY location; excess time is charged as leave. However, for funded TDYs 16 days or more and using your POV for personal convenience, Air Force policy allows permissive travel time (not chargeable as leave & no per diem payable) for the number of travel days as calculated above.
Civilian Employees:
You are limited to the constructive travel time for travel by common carrier (i.e. commercial air), usually 1 day each way, for travel to and from the TDY location; excess time is charged as leave.
If you believe you were erroneously charged leave, please contact your servicing Finance Office.
To file your settlement travel voucher, please use Defense Travel System (DTS).
To file your non-DTS settlement travel voucher, please use eFinance.

		<question>Why doesn't the LeaveWeb system allow me to request leave?</question>
		<answer>If LeaveWeb is not allowing you to request leave, you may be assigned to the incorrect unit or installation in the LeaveWeb system. Please contact your CSS/MPE LeaveWeb administrator for assistance.
A few other common reasons LeaveWeb will not allow you to submit a request are:
You are submitting a request for leave when you do not have enough days available. If you are requesting leave for more days than you have accrued, your Commander’s Support Staff/Military Personnel Element (CSS/MPE) LeaveWeb administrator will need to submit a manual advance leave request for you
It is too soon to submit your leave request. You may only submit a leave request 30 days prior to the start of your leave.
You are within 30 days of your Date of Separation (DOS) in the system.

		<question>How and where do I file for military clothing allowance?</question>
		<answer>Enlisted:  you do not have to file a claim to receive your military clothing allowance.  This allowance is automatically set up when you enter active duty and is paid automatically every year at the end of your anniversary month.
Click DFAS Military Pay Tables to find the annual allowance. (note:  the basic rate is for up to 36 months time in service, the standard rate is for more than 36 months time in service)
Officers:  you may be entitled to a one-time Uniform Equipment Allowance upon your entry on active duty.  As part of your in-processing, an AF Form 1969 will be completed which will set up your allowance.  Your initial allowance is $400.

		<question>What is the maximum actual expense allowance (AEA)?</question>
		<answer>An actual expense allowance (AEA) allows a traveler to be reimbursed, in unusual circumstances, for actual and necessary expenses that exceed the maximum locality per diem rate. The AO may authorize AEA up to 300% of the locality per diem rate (rounded to the next higher dollar).

Uniformed Members Only:
Under special/unusual circumstances or when a member has no alternative but to obtain OCONUS lodging that exceeds 300% of the applicable rate, an amount in excess of 300% may be authorized in advance only by an AEA issued by:

The PDTATAC Division Chief
The Secretary Concerned for specific OCONUS classified missions
You can be paid the actual cost meals if the Meals and Incidental Expense portion of daily per diem is authorized in the AEA.
Limitations:
The daily reimbursement limit is the lesser of the actual expenses incurred or the AEA maximum amount.
Expenses incurred and claimed must be reviewed, and allowed only when necessary and reasonable.
Depending on what AEA level is authorized/approved, reimbursement for M&IE must not exceed the percentage of AEA authorized NTE 300% of the M&IE rate for the TDY location. For example, if AEA for 200% is authorized, AEA NTE 200% of the M&IE rate for the TDY location may be paid.

		<question>Can I change the repayment terms on my advance or pay off the advance in full?</question>
		<answer>Active Duty:
Yes. Normally advances are repaid over a 12 month period. If you want to repay your advance in less time or pay off the remaining balance, contact your servicing Finance Office. If you want to extend your payback window, repayment of advance pay may be extended up to 24 months with appropriate justification and approval of your unit commander.
Repayment of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) or Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) advances can also be extended up to 24 months or length of your tour. Collection of some OHA advances for security deposits may be deferred until you vacate the housing. In all cases, advances must be repaid prior to your date of separation.

Reserve:
Yes; however, advance must be re-paid by date of separation or order termination, whichever occurs first.

		<question>What is the Controlled Spend Account (CSA) card?</question>
		<answer>The Controlled Spend Account (CSA) card was a pilot program that offered improvements to the old Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) program, but it also posed significant challenges to frequent travelers and unique mission sets. In our customer's best interests, the decision was made to transition the CSA card back to an enhanced GTCC program. The transition of the CSA cards back to GTCCs was completed in October 2012.
Holders of the CSA "blue card" can continue using them under the enhanced GTCC program and will not need to get a new card. Travelers will once again be provided with a permanent credit limit, and there will be no need to call for "temporary spend limit" increases, although your APC still has the authority to increase GTCC limits to meet mission requirements.

		<question>What are my travel allowances upon separation or retirement?</question>
		<answer>If you are separating from active duty, you are authorized travel and transportation allowances from your last permanent duty station (PDS) to either your Home of Record (HOR) or your Place of Entry on Active Duty (PLEAD).
If you are retiring from active duty, you are authorized travel and transportation allowances from your last PDS to your Home of Selection (HOS). For HOS conditions see JTR Chap 5 Part A Para 5068 (Travel to HOS), available at the link below.
Generally, the following entitlements apply:
Per diem: You are authorized 100% of the standard CONUS per diem rate (currently $123), which includes Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) and Lodging, multiplied by the number of actual travel days not to exceed the authorized travel days. Your spouse and each child 12 or over are authorized 75% of your allowances, and each child under 12 is authorized 50% of your allowance. If your driving involves OCONUS locations, your per diem rate would be the OCONUS locality rate.
PCS allowances while flying: Your per diem will be based on the locality rate of your destination or authorized stop over point. You will get per diem for the actual travel time used, not to include any travel for leave. Normally, for travel in CONUS, one travel day is allowed for travel by air. Your spouse and children 12 and over are authorized 75% of your per diem allowance; children under 12 are authorized 50% of your per diem allowance.

If you purchase your own airfare, you will be reimbursed not to exceed the cost of government procured tickets for the official travel. NOTE: You cannot purchase transoceanic or non-US carrier airfare for your own transportation; any transoceanic or OCONUS travel arrangements must be made through your servicing Transportation Management Office (TMO).  

If you have served less than 90% of your initial enlistment, then you are entitled to transportation allowances (not including per diem) for the least expensive mode of transportation available, or you may choose to be paid an amount up to the government's cost of such transportation.

		<question>What TDY allowances can I get on my annual tour?</question>
		<answer>Per diem Allowances:
If all meals are available and directed and you are lodged on base, you are not authorized per diem except for travel days. Per diem rate is 75% of the TDY locality rate for travel days.

Other TDY Allowances:
You may be authorized additional TDY allowances (reimbursable expenses) if they are approved in your TDY orders or after the fact by the orders Approving Official (AO). Some examples include (but not limited to):
rental car/fuel
official phone calls/Internet charges
baggage tips 
passport fees

		<question>Why do I not automatically receive the maximum Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA)?</question>
		<answer>You do not automatically receive the max OHA locality rate because OHA is based on a computation of your actual rent (not to exceed the max locality rate), utility and recurring maintenance expenses, and move-in housing allowance (MIHA).
If your rent is below the maximum rental allowance, the amount you actually pay will be used to compute your allowance. If your rent is above the maximum rental allowance, you will be capped at your maximum locality rate.
To make changes to your OHA, please use eFinance to complete a DD Form 2367, Individual Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) Report.

		<question>How much time do I have to pay back an Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) advance?</question>
		<answer>Normally, you have up to 12 months to repay an OHA advance.  Collection of your advance OHA will begin in the month after the advance was paid.  For example, if your advance OHA was paid on 13 June, collection will begin in July.  Normal collection of your advance is over a 12 month period.
When a postponement or extension of the repayment beyond 12 months is justified, it may be authorized by your Unit Commander. If a postponement is authorized by your commander, collection will begin in the 3rd month after the advance was paid.
Collection of the portion of your advance that represents advance rent or security deposit may be postponed until you vacate the housing.  If postponement is authorized by your commander, you must return the entire security deposit refunded to you by your landlord to the Finance Office.  If your entire security deposit is not returned to you by your landlord, collection will begin on the remaining amount and may be paid in monthly installments.
To request an advance payment of OHA, please use eFinance.

		<question>How can I be reimbursed for off-base lodging?</question>
		<answer>If your orders direct you to a town or location, as opposed to a U.S Installation, all you need to do is claim your off-base lodging on your travel voucher to be reimbursed. 
If your orders direct you to a U.S. Installation, you must check with that local installation for government quarters availability. You must document quarters availability on your travel authorization/order/voucher with:
A confirmation number provided by the installation lodging office
The date you attempted to make reservations, and the phone number and name of the Billeting Office POC, or
Your certification that government quarters were not available upon arrival
With the above documentation, claim your off-base lodging on your travel voucher to be reimbursed.
Civilian employees:
You may not be directed/required to use government quarters, nor, except for formal training, may your lodging reimbursement be limited to the government quarters cost. However, in compliance with the requirement to exercise prudence when incurring expenses, you should check for government quarters availability and are encouraged to use those quarters when TDY to a military installation.
To file your settlement travel voucher, please use Defense Travel System (DTS).
To file your non-DTS settlement travel voucher, please use eFinance.

If you are able to purchase, or are provided meals at the government mess, then it is considered available. The payment of BAS is independent of the reality of government dining/mess being available.

		<question>I am a reservist, why was I paid only the Basic Allowance for Housing - RC rate (BAH-RC)?</question>
		<answer>As a reservist, if you are called to active duty for 30 days or less, you are only authorized to receive BAH-RC.
If you are called or ordered to active duty for more than 30 days (or for any length contingency operation), you are authorized to receive BAH at the rate for your primary residence. For longer active duty tours (i.e. more than 180 days), where HHGs are authorized to be moved, you may be entitled to BAH at the rate for your new permanent duty station (PDS).
Your BAH is determined by your grade, dependency status, primary residence, & (upon a PCS), your PDS. See BAH Rates.
Please contact your servicing Finance Office if you believe you are receiving the incorrect BAH rate.

		<question>What are the steps involved in a personally procured move (PPM, formerly DITY)?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members:
A personally procured move (PPM, formerly DITY) means you have decided to move your Household Goods (HHG) yourself or hire a private company to move your HHG. If you elect this option, you will be paid 95 percent of what it would have cost the government to move your HHG. To be eligible for this option, you must either have orders authorizing PCS, TDY with HHG allowance, or assignment to/from government quarters.
First, you must contact the Traffic Management Office (TMO) to obtain a DD Form 2278 (Application For Do It Yourself Move And Counseling Checklist). Based on a weight estimate you provide, TMO will use this form to compute your allowance for personally moving your HHG. TMO will also compute an amount that you can receive in advance of your move to help minimize out of pocket expenses.
Then, upon completion of your PPM, you are required to submit your PPM claim to TMO for validation. Once TMO has validated the accuracy of your claim, it will be forwarded to the Finance Office for payment. Please check with TMO to find out if they automatically forward your claim to the Finance Office. In some instances, you may be required to take your claim to the Finance Office.
Civilian Employees:
Refer to your PCS orders for HHG transportation information. Contact your servicing Personal Property Shipping Office (i.e. TMO) for additional information on reimbursement steps. Generally, you are limited to the government cost of actual expenses incurred, NTE the cost of a government arranged move for the same HHG weight or the commuted rate method for interstate HHG shipments between CONUS PDSs...whichever method your servicing Personal Property Shipping Office has approved as advantageous for HHG transportation.

		<question>How does Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) affect my tax return?</question>
		<answer>Your PCS move is taxable. The purpose of RITA is to not only cover the taxes you incur at the time of the claim, but also the possibility that the PCS allowances you receive may increase your income for the year and put you in a higher tax bracket.
Each year you process claims, to include the RITA claim, you will receive a W-2. This W-2 needs to be submitted with your Federal tax return.

		<question>How do I repay a travel debt?</question>
		<answer>Your options are to either send a check, cashier's check, or money order to the AFFSC or have the debt deducted from your paycheck.

If you pay by check, cashier's check, or money order, please make your payment out to: DSSN 3801 and mail to:

Air Force Financial Services Center
2700 Doolittle Drive Suite 113
Ellsworth AFB, SD 57706

If you choose payroll deduction, repayment will not be less than $50 per month unless you have MAJCOM approval for an extended repayment up to 36 months. Repayment cannot exceed your Date of Separation (DOS).

As part of the due process requirements, you are given 30 days from the date you are notified of the debt to determine which action you will take.  At the end of the 30 day period if you have taken no action, we will start the process to collect the debt from your pay.

		<answer>Yes.  The military pay system has systemic scheduled cut off dates for each pay period, which are normally on or about the 5th and 20th of each month. Any transactions processed after the cut off for a specific pay period will not be reflected until the following pay period.
NOTE: Generally, military pay documents received by your Finance Office by the 1st of the month will be reflected in your mid-month pay and documents received after the 1st and before the 16th of the month normally will be reflected in your end-of-month pay.

		<question>What pay and entitlements are tax exempt in a designated combat zone?</question>
		<answer>All military pay that you earn as an enlisted member is exempt from taxation for any month that you serve all or part of the month in a designated combat zone. For example, if you enter the designated combat zone on January 25th and depart the zone on May 5th, all pay that you earn for January, February, March, April and May is exempt from taxes.   
If you're a commissioned officer, your exemption is limited. Your monthly tax exemption is limited to the sum of the highest rate of enlisted basic pay plus the amount of Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay payable to you during the qualifying month in the combat zone. The combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) applies to both federal and state income tax withholding.  The exemption does not apply to amounts deducted for Social Security and Medicare.

		<answer>The most likely reason would be that your duty status has not been updated from "confinement" to "present for duty". Please contact your servicing Finance Office to verify the duty status reflected on your pay account. If your duty status is incorrect, then you will need to contact your servicing Personnel Office to process the updated transactions. Another reason for non-payment could be the collection of any fines or forfeitures resulting from a courts-martial sentence. You should review your LES on myPay and contact your servicing Finance Office with any questions.</answer>

		<question>As an officer, what documentation is required for a civilian clothing allowance?</question>
		<answer>If you are stationed outside of the United States, and if you are required to wear civilian clothes more than half the time while performing official duties, the authorization will come from published orders that state that you're required to wear civilian clothing. Entitlement information can be obtained in DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 29 Para 290403 (Civilian Clothing Allowances for Officers and Enlisted).
Officers are only entitled to a civilian clothing allowance if their PDS is outside the United States.
Reserve members are not authorized civilian clothing allowance unless they are on active duty for more than 6 months. If on duty for more than six months, follow guidance in the DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 29 Para 290403 (Civilian Clothing Allowances for Officers and Enlisted) in addition to the AFI 36-3014.

		<question>What could cause my Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate to change?</question>
		<answer>There are many circumstances that affect your BAH rate. The most common are:
Type of tour - standard active duty tour or contingency (normal BAH regardless or tour length)
Length of tour - 30 days or less, BAH-RC applies; 31+ days, normal rate BAH applies for either your residence or primary duty station, as applicable 
Change in marital status - if you get married or divorced or if your spouse enters active duty or separates
Child support - if you are providing child support for a child who is your sole dependent and who is not in your custody
Birth/Death - birth of a child if you are not married, or death of a spouse with no children involved
Promotion/Demotion - the rate will update automatically when Military Personnel Element (MPE) updates your pay grade
Moving in or out of housing or the dorms - Housing or the dorm manager will prepare the AF Form 594 (Application and Authorization to start, stop or change BAQ or Dependency Re-determination) to stop or start your allowance as appropriate
Relocation for a PCS - your BAH will continue at your old rate until you sign in to your new duty station in most cases
There are also some unique situations involving dependency determinations and recertification that could cause your BAH rate to change.

		<question>I am deployed to a Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) location, why was my reenlistment bonus taxed?</question>
		<answer>Your entire bonus, to include subsequent annual payments, is tax exempt if you reenlisted during a month when you were authorized Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE).  If your reenlistment occurred during a month when you were not authorized CZTE, then both the initial and the annual installments will be taxed, even if you are authorized CZTE when the annual installment is paid.

See your local Finance Office if you reenlisted during a month you were authorized CZTE and your bonus was taxed.

		<question>If I am in a confinement status, do my dependents continue to receive my pay?</question>
		<answer>There are many different types of confinement statuses. Each type of confinement status has a different effect on your pay and allowances:

1. Confinement by civil authorities: suspend pay and allowances.

2. Confinement by military or civil authorities as a civil witness: continue accrual of pay and allowance; however, if food is provided by military authorities then BAS and COLA without dependents, for enlisted members must be suspended.

3. Military confinement awaiting investigation or court-martial: suspend BAS and COLA without dependents for enlisted members, suspend incentive pays, and stop accruals of pay and allowances if ETS occurs while in confinement.

4. Military confinement-serving a court-martial sentence: BAS and COLA without dependents for enlisted members, suspend some incentive pays, and stop accruals of pay and allowances if ETS occurs while in confinement.

5. Military confinement for foreign civil offense pending charge of indictment: suspend BAS and COLA without dependents for enlisted members, suspend incentive pays, and stop accruals of pay and allowances if ETS occurs while in confinement.

6. Military confinement for foreign civil offense-indicted: suspend pay and allowances.

Depending if you are an officer or an enlisted, there are some different effects on your pay and allowances when you're confined.

In military court-martials, the convening authority (usually the Wing Commander), has the authority to waive any or all of the forfeitures for the period of confinement not to exceed six months, so as to direct an involuntary allotment to provide for the support of the accused's dependents.

		<question>What steps do I have to take to receive advance Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA)?</question>
		<answer>To receive advance OHA, your lease must first be approved by your local Housing Office.  Once your lease is approved, the Housing Office can authorize your advance.  You will need to fill out an AF Form 1039 to request the advance.  All housing expenses (advance rent, security deposit) requested must be documented.  Once you fill out your AF 1039, it must be signed by your commander.  Once signed, take your AF 1039 and your lease to your local Finance Office for processing and payment.
You may use eFinance to fill out and print your AF Form 1039.  You will still need to take the form and your lease to your servicing Finance Office for processing and payment.

		<question>Why did my pay increase between September and December?</question>
		<answer>A common reason why your pay may have increased between September and December is because you reached the maximum deduction for Social Security tax for the year.  As a result, no further deductions for Social Security tax will be made for the rest of the tax year; however, deductions will continue for the Medicare Hospital Insurance Tax.</answer>

		<question>Can I store my privately owned vehicle (POV) at government expense while I am OCONUS?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members:
Yes, you may store your POV at government expense when ordered to PCS to an OCONUS permanent duty station (PDS) that falls under one of these categories:

Laws, regulations, and/or other restrictions imposed by the foreign country, area, or the United States preclude shipment/entry of a motor vehicle at Government expense into that OCONUS PDS.
Your vehicle would require extensive modification (other than normal maintenance) as a condition to entry into the OCONUS PDS.
You may also store your POV at government expense if serving on a contingency type TDY for more than 30 days.
Civilian Employees:
POV storage is only authorized for your POV in the event of an ordered evacuation, provided the POV was shipped at government expense.

		<question>Why don't I get reimbursed for driving to Unit Training Assembly (UTA)/Inactive Duty Training (IDT)?</question>
		<answer>The UTA/IDT duty is normally performed at your permanent duty location, and it is considered a normal commute to and from work. Because of that, you will not be reimbursed for the travel expenses.  However, there is an exception for certain members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve who commute outside the local commuting distance who are:
- qualified in a skill designated as critically short by the Secretary Concerned;
- assigned to a unit of the Selected Reserve with a critical staffing shortage, or in a pay grade in the member’s RC with a critical staffing shortage; or
- assigned to a unit/position that is disestablished or relocated as a result of Defense BRAC or other force structure reallocation.
To determine your eligibility, please contact your servicing Reserve Payroll Office.

		<question>What is my TDY per diem?</question>
		<answer>Your per diem rate varies by location. You can find your per diem rate by going to this link: Per Diem Rates. Enter the state or country you are traveling to and click on 'Execute' to get the applicable per diem for the specific location.
The per diem you receive is based on the meals statement on your orders. If you are TDY to a base and all meals are available at a base dining facility, you will receive the government meal rate listed in Appendix A, plus the applicable incidental expense ($5.00 CONUS or $3.50 OCONUS). If all meals are provided to you at no cost (e.g., if you are deployed), then you will receive just the incidental expense ($3.50). If you have proportional or full (local) meals, then follow the notes on the per diem page to calculate the daily rate.

		<question>Am I eligible for an emergency payment?</question>
		<answer>Emergency military pay payments are approved on a case by case basis with approval from your commander or first sergeant. An emergency military pay payment is most likely to be granted to resolve a quality of life issue or an emergency situation. For example, your electricity and / or other utilities are about to be discontinued unless you receive an emergency payment to pay the bill. The amount may not exceed your accrued pay and allowances to date less normal statutory deductions.

For situations involving a short notice TDY tasking where you do not have a Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) or where GTCC use is restricted, you may be eligible for an emergency travel payment.
Your emergency payment (military pay or travel) will be issued by your servicing Finance Office once you submit the necessary documentation. The type of payment (cash, check, or electronic funds transfer (EFT)) will be determined by your servicing Finance Office based on circumstances particular to your case and supporting documentation.
Reservists: You must be in an active duty status and have a copy of your active duty orders in order to be eligible for an emergency military pay payment.

		<question>What is Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA) and how do I qualify?</question>
		<answer>Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA) program is a voluntary financial benefits program for military families, intended to increase a service member's income in order to remove their household from eligibility for SNAP benefits (formerly the food stamp program).
Eligibility is based on the income for all members of the household and the number of people living in the household. For example, if you have 5 people living in your household then you must have income below $2,987 per month (when living in the 48 states) to be eligible.
You can determine your eligibility and apply for FSSA at the following website:  Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA)
Upon completion of the FSSA application, submit to your Commander for further processing.

		<question>Why didn't I get a copy of my paid travel voucher?</question>
		<answer>Remember that there are two methods of processing your travel vouchers. For vouchers that are created and processed electronically through the Defense Travel System (DTS), you will receive an electronic notification when that voucher is completed and paid; you can view and print the voucher by accessing DTS.
For non-DTS vouchers such as PCS and most deployment travel, when the voucher is paid, a copy is emailed to the address on file in the Reserve Travel System (RTS). If you didn't get a copy, it could be that an incorrect email address is on file in RTS or there could have been a delay in processing your voucher. You should contact your servicing Finance Office for assistance.

		<question>How much am I authorized for miscellaneous expense allowance?</question>
		<answer>If you're an employee without dependents or you elect not to relocate your dependents and household goods, you're entitled to a flat rate of $500.00 or one week of basic compensation, whichever is less. If you're an employee with dependents, you're entitled to a flat rate of $1,000.00 or two weeks basic compensation, whichever is less.

		<question>How do I claim state tax exempt status?</question>
		<answer>Certain states allow military members to claim exemption from state tax withholding when they're stationed outside their state of legal residence.  You must meet your state's requirements for exemption.  You can claim exemption by completing the required form and submitting it for processing.   

The required form for claiming tax exempt status may vary by state. The most common form is the DD Form 2058-1 (State Income Tax Exemption Certificate) which applies to California, Idaho, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. California, Idaho, Pennsylvania and Vermont also allow members to use a W-4 Form.  For state tax exemption, you can complete and submit these  forms electronically using the myPay system.  
Ohio residents must complete Form IT 4 MIL which is available at the following link Ohio Taxation Department.  Connecticut requires you to use the CT-W4 which is available at the following link: Connecticut Department of Revenue.  Submit these forms to your Finance Office for processing after you complete them. 
For legal residents of Connecticut only:  If you declare an exemption from withholding for Connecticut you must certify that exemption every year.  If your new certification is not processed by 15 February, then withholding will automatically restart beginning on 16 February.

		<question>How do I request Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA)?</question>
		<answer>To claim your TLA, you will need to take your lodging receipt to the Housing Office.  The Housing Office will assist you with filling out the AF Form 1357, and will then forward it to the Finance Office for processing.  Because your departing Housing Office will be more familiar with the local circumstances, it is always best to turn in your receipts to the Housing Office before your departure.
You are only entitled to TLA if you are on active duty for training (ADT) for 140 or more days or on active duty for other than training for more than 180 days.

		<question>What is Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA)?</question>
		<answer>OHA is a monthly allowance to help offset private overseas housing costs, including rent and utilities. Alaska and Hawaii are not considered overseas for OHAs. Your allowance will be determined by your actual rent, which may not exceed the rental ceiling for your location. Rental ceilings are calculated based on duty location, rank and dependency status. OHA is meant to compensate you for the majority of your housing expenses. The computation is comprised of three components: rental allowance, the recurring maintenance allowance, and move-in housing allowance (MIHA).</answer>

		<question>Why am I being charged leave when I was traveling to/from my TDY location?</question>
		<answer>The Finance Office determines the number of travel days that you are allowed based on your TDY location and the mode of transportation authorized.  If your travel time exceeds that allowable travel time, the Finance Office will charge military members leave for any excess travel time.  Excess travel time are days not included in the allowable travel time or days not categorized as permissive travel time.  Civilian employees ensure that their excess travel time is reported as leave in the time and attendance reporting system as appropriate.

		<question>Why does my Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) fluctuate month to month?</question>
		<answer>When necessary, the Per Diem Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee (PDTATAC) reviews and adjusts the exchange rates for countries where members are assigned. Adjustments to COLA are made as frequently as twice a month, and they are based solely on currency fluctuations.  COLA is a daily allowance; therefore you will receive more in a month with 31 days than in a month with 30 days.</answer>

		<question>Why does my LES show only five dependents for my Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) entitlement, when I actually have six dependents?</question>
		<answer>A factor in determining OCONUS COLA is the portion of your income used to purchase certain goods and services in the overseas area.  This is known as spendable income. Another factor is the number of your dependents, up to five. As family sizes exceed five dependents, more income is devoted to housing expenses, leaving less to spend on the goods and services used in determining COLA rates. At that number of dependents, members have reached the point where they have maximized the percentage of income that they devote to spending on COLA items for dependents.

		<question>Where can I store my privately owned vehicle (POV)?</question>
		<answer>You can store your POV in the facilities listed below:
Government procured storage facility
Member procured commercial storage facility
Non-commercial storage facility (storage in a private residence, garage, or on a private lot does not constitute storage at a commercial facility and you will not be reimbursed for these costs.)
Note: your local Traffic Management Office (TMO) must authorize all storage types prior to contracting with a storage facility. To receive reimbursement for POV storage you must store your POV in a commercial storage facility, or be directed by the TMO office to personally procure storage at a commercial facility. If government procured storage is available and you choose to store your vehicle elsewhere, your reimbursement for storage is limited to reimbursement for actual storage costs not to exceed the government’s cost to store your POV. POV storage in a private facility is not authorized and costs will not be reimbursed to the member.

Civilian Employees: You may store your POV at a place determined to be reasonable in conjunction with an OCONUS evacuation.

		<question>When I get married enroute to my new duty station, do I receive Dislocation Allowance (DLA) at the with dependent rate?</question>
		<answer>Your entitlement to with dependent rate of DLA is determined by the effective date of your PCS orders. The effective date of orders is your arrival date at your new duty station minus the number of authorized travel days plus one day.  For example, if you reported to your new duty station on 15 August, and you were authorized and used 4 travel days, your effective date of orders would be 12 August (15 August - 4 travel days + 1 day = 12 August).

If you were married on or before 12 August, you will be authorized the with dependent rate of DLA. If you were married after that date, you are not authorized DLA at the with dependent rate.  You will need to contact your personnel office to have your orders amended to include your spouse.

You will be required to fill out an AF Form 594 (Application and Authorization to start, stop or change BAQ or Dependency Re-determination) and provide the appropriate official documentation for the status change (marriage license, divorce decree, birth certificate, etc.).

		<question>Why hasn't my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contribution percentage been updated in myPay?</question>
		<answer>TSP contribution percentage changes are not visible until the calendar month following the month in which you made the change. However, if you make a change towards the end of a calendar month, it may not be reflected until two calendar months after the month in which you made the change. This is due to normal processing lag.
If you have further questions, please call 1-TSP-YOU-FRST (1-877-968-3778) or go to the Thrift Savings Plan Website.

		<question>What effect will a change of duty status have on my pay check and entitlements?</question>
		<answer>When your duty status changes, your entitlements may be adjusted.

For example, if your duty status changes to confinement, the type of confinement determines impact on your pay. Generally, if you are in civil confinement, you stop accruing pay and leave when civil confinement status starts. If you are in military confinement, you do not accrue leave and your Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) is stopped, as well as Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) without dependents, if you're enlisted. If you're confined as a civil witness, BAS and COLA without dependents, for enlisted members, is stopped. For any confinement status, when you are restored to duty status you start to accrue pay and leave again, but adjustments will be made to your service dates to account for lost time.

If your duty status changes to absent without leave (AWOL) or desertion, you do not accrue any pay or leave effective the date you start in that status.  In addition, your allotments will be stopped. When your AWOL or desertion status ends, you'll start to accrue pay and leave again, provided you enter a status that accrues pay and leave.  In other words, if your status changes from AWOL or desertion to civil confinement, you don't begin to accrue pay and leave again.

		<answer>You will receive CONUS COLA if assigned to a CONUS high cost area and the location is designated to receive CONUS COLA as authorized by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
You may also receive CONUS COLA if you are assigned OCONUS in an unaccompanied status and your primary dependent resides in a CONUS high cost area designated to receive CONUS COLA. 
See CONUS COLA Rates for CONUS COLA areas and rates.
For Reservists, you must be called to active duty for more than 140 days or in support of a contingency in order to receive CONUS COLA. Your rate will be based on your home address and not your duty location.  See CONUS COLA Rates for CONUS COLA areas and rates.

		<question>Do I get my hotels reimbursed if I drive my Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)?</question>
		<answer>If your order approving official authorizes travel by POV as more advantageous to the government, you will be reimbursed for lodging costs incurred during your authorized travel time. If you drive your POV for your own personal convenience, your reimbursement is limited to the constructed travel cost. The constructed travel cost is the amount the government would have incurred for you to travel by common carrier (airplane). In summary, if the hotel cost is within the constructed cost (e.g. the government scheduled tranporation route included an overnight stop), then it will be reimbursed.

To file your settlement travel voucher, please use Defense Travel System (DTS).
To file your non-DTS settlement travel voucher, please use eFinance.

		<question>If I am provided a free or complimentary meal during my TDY, how does it affect my per diem?</question>
		<answer>Your per diem may be reduced, depending upon the following circumstances:
A meal provided at no cost by the government is a deductible meal, must be claimed on your travel voucher, and will reduce your per diem to either the proportional rate or the government rate (not including box/’bagged’ meal from a GOV’T dining facility/mess).
A meal provided at no cost (or included in a reimbursable conference fee) as part of a conference, is a deductible meal, must be claimed on your travel voucher, and will reduce your per diem to either the proportional rate or the government rate.
A complimentary meal provided by a lodging establishment is not a deductible meal, provided the room charge is the same with or without meals, and will not affect your per diem.
A complimentary meal provided by a common carrier (plane, train, etc) is not a deductible meal and will not affect your per diem.

		<answer>First, confirm that your deployment is to a area designated for the CZTE by reviewing DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 44 (Withholding of Income Tax).  If so, and federal taxes are still being deducted from your pay, contact your deployed Finance Office and they will help get your CZTE transaction processed. 
If you are an officer, the monthly amount of tax excluded income is limited to the highest rate of basic pay for an enlisted member plus the amount of Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) due you for the month.

		<question>Why is my BAH different from someone at my duty location who has the same rank as I do?</question>
		<answer>If you are receiving a different BAH allowance than someone from the same duty location that has the same rank as you, BAH Rate Protection is probably in effect for one of you.  The monthly BAH amount must not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the MHA (Military Housing Area), changes in the national monthly housing cost, or a member's promotion.  One of you is most likely receiving a higher BAH in an area where there was a BAH reduction.  This grandfathering protects the member from BAH fluctuations.
To check the rate of BAH for your PDS (Note, BAH is based on your PDS Zip Code, not your home Zip Code) and rank, please visit DTMO's BAH Rates web site.
However, if you believe this is not the case (i.e. the rate in your area did not decrease and you are not subject to BAH Rate Protection), then you should immediately contact your servicing Finance Office to ensure you are not over or under paid.

		<question>How much can I receive for a military advance pay / housing advance?</question>

For military advance pay as a result of a PCS, you may be authorized up to three months basic pay minus standard deductions. You are only authorized advance military pay in conjunction with a PCS move or a deployment for more than 365 days to an area subject to hostile fire/imminent danger pay.

For a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) advance, you are authorized up to three months of your anticipated housing allowance or your anticipated housing expenses, whichever is less.

For an Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) advance, the amount you may be advanced is determined on the basis of your housing expenses including advance rent and security deposit.
To request an advance payment of pay, BAH, or OHA, please use eFinance.

Reserve:
Same as active duty; however, you must be in a PCS status for 20 weeks or more and the advance must be re-paid by date of separation or order termination, whichever occurs first.

		<question>Why didn't I get my combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) refund?</question>
		<answer>The most likely reason why you did not get your CZTE tax refund is because a travel voucher was not filed upon your return from the combat zone or it was filed and the CZTE entitlement was not processed.
If you have not yet filed your travel voucher, you need to submit it immediately so that your entitlements can be updated. Please follow the appropriate link to eFinance or Defense Travel System (DTS) to file your deployment travel voucher. If you have filed your voucher, and it has been paid but you did not receive your CZTE tax refund, contact your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>How many days before/after my lease starts can I receive an advance overseas housing allowance (OHA)?</question>
		<answer>Normally, advance OHA is paid no earlier than 3 workdays before you are required to make payment under a lease or purchase plan.  Except under extraordinary circumstances, payment of the advance must be made within 30 days after occupancy.
When extraordinary circumstances warrant, the Housing Office can approve a payment more than 30 days after occupancy. You will need to submit a written request to the Housing Office for approval.  The request must briefly state the reason for the delayed advance and must show that the funds are needed to meet advance rent, security deposit, or initial expenses.

		<question>What are the benefits of taking leave versus selling leave in conjunction with separation or retirement?</question>
		<answer>If you choose to take leave, you will receive basic pay, basic allowance for subsistence (BAS), and basic allowance for housing (BAH) for those days you take.
If you choose to sell leave, you will receive basic pay for those days sold, less federal taxes and any applicable state taxes. Also, when you work those days that you could have taken as leave but chose to sell, you will still receive all your entitlements and base pay for those days after your final work day.
For example, A member has 30 days of leave and is choosing to take or sell leave.
Option to "Take Leave": If the member elects to take 30 days of leave, the member will receive basic pay, BAS, BAH for the 30 days, less Federal Taxes and any applicable state taxes.
Option to "Sell Leave": If the member elects to sell the leave, the member will receive payment of basic pay for the 30 days of leave sold, less Federal Taxes and any applicable state taxes. You are not paid BAS or BAH for the days of leave that you sell.

For example, A member has 30 days of leave, is separating 1 May, and is choosing to take or sell leave.
Option to "Take Leave": If member takes the leave, their last duty day will be 1 April and they will receive full pay and allowances until 1 May.
Option to "Sell Leave": If member sells the leave, they still receive full pay and allowances until 1 May, and in addition will also get the 30 days of base pay, less federal taxes and any applicable state taxes, in their final pay.

		<question>What documentation does the Finance Office require to update my Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate if I have a change in dependents?</question>

Birth certificate
Death certificate
Divorce decree
Marriage certificate
You will also need to submit a completed AF Form 594 (Application and Authorization to start, stop or change BAQ or Dependency Re-determination) to the Finance Office.

		<question>Can I get Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) at the same time?</question>
		<answer>Yes, under certain conditions, you can receive BAH and OHA at the same time. The most common scenario for receiving BAH and OHA at the same time is that you are serving a dependent restricted tour and you live off-base at your PDS.  In this scenario, you would receive single rate OHA (Family Separation Housing-OHA Based Location, FSH-O) at your overseas location and with-dependent rate BAH for the location of your dependents.
There are other possible scenarios concerning BAH and OHA. Please contact your servicing Finance Office to discuss the details of your specific situation.
To initiate, change, or update your BAH or OHA, please use eFinance.

		<question>What impact will a tax levy have on my pay?</question>
		<answer>An Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax levy, once applied to your pay, will result in a substantial monthly reduction of your pay until the levy is satisfied. If a notice of levy is received, you will be notified and provided an opportunity to complete a statement of personal exemptions. This will exempt a specific amount from the levy for each of your dependents as well as an amount for yourself. In addition, the law will exempt an amount to allow you to comply with court-ordered child support requirements. You will also have an opportunity to specify the order in which voluntary allotments are to be canceled, if you desire, to repay the levy. Generally, stopping allotments is voluntary, except in cases specified by the IRS.

The total amount will be listed on the notice of levy that you receive from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The monthly deduction amount is determined after you complete your statement of personal exemptions on TD Form 668-P. Your 'take home pay', minus the exempt amounts for you, your dependents and court-ordered child support, will be attached and sent to the IRS to satisfy the levy. 
The levy will be applied against your pay as soon as possible and will continue until the levy is totally satisfied or lifted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Questions regarding your tax levy, including any requests to change the amount of the levy or the monthly repayment, must be directed to the IRS.

		<answer>You will receive your final paycheck via electronic funds transfer (EFT). The payment will go to the same EFT account as your military pay, unless you choose to change this account.  You will have the opportunity to update your EFT account when you submit your retirement or separation package to your local Finance Office.

Your DOS is the effective day of payment, but please allow 3-5 business days for processing due to the need for a manual final pay computation by your servicing Finance Office. If you have not received your final pay within 5 business days after your DOS, contact your servicing Finance Office.
To calculate an estimate of your final paycheck, please use our Final Separation Pay Calculator.

		<question>What are the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rates based on?</question>
		<answer>BAH is based on your permanent duty station zip code, pay grade, and dependency status. The determination of BAH is based upon the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area. If housing costs go up for higher incomes and down for lower incomes, those changes could result in enlisted getting less BAH while officers get more BAH, or vice versa. BAH rates are always grandfathered, so no one will ever receive a BAH decrease while stationed at the same base. Cost data is collected by an independent company for every location every year. That data is fed into a formula to determine the BAH rates for the following year.

Go to BAH Info for more information.
To make changes to your BAH (due to marriage, divorce, new child, etc.), please use eFinance.

		<question>How will I be charged leave on my PCS voucher?</question>
		<answer>You will be charged leave for day(s) that are in excess of your allowable travel time between your old and new permanent duty station (PDS).
You will not be charged for proceed time or authorized delays if you are doing the following :
Recruiters Assistance Program (RAP), Permissive TDY (PTDY) or TDY.
When you file your PCS voucher, any leave to be charged will automatically be charged against your leave account by your servicing Finance Office.
Also, the day(s) you actually took for leave, while en-route to your new PDS, are not always the same day(s) that will appear as charged on your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES).

		<question>Does my Commander have to authorize my TDY advance?</question>
		<answer>Not in all cases.
If your orders authorize you to receive an advance payment and state that "the cardholder is not able to use a Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) to charge major chargeable expenses and/or is not able to obtain a cash advance through the Government ATM Cash Advance Program" then you do not need Commander approval.
If your orders do not authorize advance payment, then you will need Commander approval.
Please use eFinance to process your travel advance request.

		<question>Am I eligible for Family Separation Allowance (FSA) if my TDY is in the local area?</question>
		<answer>You are not entitled to FSA if all of your dependents reside within the local area of your TDY location.
If some (but not all) of your dependents voluntarily reside near the TDY location, FSA may accrue on behalf of those dependents who do not reside at or near the TDY location.
To be eligible for FSA, your TDY has to be more than 30 days.  FSA is payable at a rate of $250 per month and is prorated on a daily basis.

		<question>Why didn't my Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) stop?</question>
		<answer>Processing lead times can cause the stop to occur after the period when the entitlement ceased, causing an indebtedness.
When you file your travel voucher, your Finance Office processes a transaction to stop your HFP or IDP.  If you have already filed your travel voucher and have received HFP or IDP for any month after the month you depart the hostile fire area or designated IDP area, please contact your Finance Office.
Until 31 December 2011, both HFP and IDP were paid for the entire month, even if you were not in a designated IDP area for the entire month. A change in the law now requires us to prorate IDP and pay it based on the number of days you perform duty in a designated IDP area.  That means that if you perform duty in a designated IDP area for 17 days in a month, you will be paid 17 days of the daily rate for IDP.  HFP continues to be paid on a monthly, non-prorated basis.  This can be confusing, so let's use a couple of examples.
If you were entitled to HFP because your aircraft was fired upon, you will be paid HFP for the entire month of the incident.
However, if you were entitled to IDP and left the designated area on the 10th of the month, you are entitled to IDP for 10 days in the month. If the IDP continues to pay for the remainder of the month, when it is stopped, it will be retroactive to the day you departed the IDP area.
Reservists - HFP/IDP is stopped when you submit a copy of your final settlement travel voucher to your servicing Finance Office upon return from TDY.

		<question>How many days of convalescent leave can I take in total?</question>
		<answer>Your initial period of convalescent leave can not exceed 30 days. If additional days are needed, then a medical review and military medical consent are required.

Your period of convalescent leave must be recommended by a Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) authority or the attending physician most familiar with your condition and approved by your unit commander.

The exception to the this rule is convalescent leave due to pregnancy or childbirth. In these cases, you will automatically receive an initial convalescent leave period of 42 days.
You can come back early from convalescent leave, but you must get approval from the proper Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) authority or attending physician most familiar with your condition before returning early.
To extend your convalescent leave, your unit commander will approve or deny your request for extension based on a written recommendation from the proper Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) authority or attending physician most familiar with your condition.

		<question>As a Reservist, is my bonus taxable?</question>
		<answer>Bonus payments are subject to federal and state (if applicable) withholding.  Federal income tax is currently deducted at 25% for one-time entitlements such as bonuses.

If you earn a bonus in any month during which the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) applies, your bonus and all subsequent installments are tax exempt.

However, if you earn your bonus during a month in which you are not entitled to the CZTE, your bonus and all subsequent installments are subjects to tax withholding.

For officers, the maximum monthly amount that is exempt from withholding is equal to the pay of the highest enlisted member (CMSAF) plus the monthly Hostile Fire Pay received.

If you believe you have been taxed in error, contact your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>Why are Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) meal deductions still being taken out even after my unit completed all paper work?</question>
		<answer>There are two common reasons why your meal deductions may not have been stopped yet:  
Your Commander's Support Staff (CSS) may not have forwarded your paperwork to the Finance Office yet, or
Your CSS may have forwarded your paperwork, but not in time to take effect in the current pay period.
If your meal deduction has not stopped and you confirmed that your CSS has forwarded the paperwork, then you should contact your servicing Finance Office.   You can use the lookup tool on the virtual Finance website to locate an email address for your Finance Office.

If you have significant travel expenses to get to your TDY point, the 30 day rule for the first accrual may be waived for an immediate payment to your Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC).
To file your accrual travel voucher, please use Defense Travel System (DTS).

To file your non-DTS accrual travel voucher, please use eFinance or vMPF, as applicable.

		<question>How do I apply for military advance pay / housing advance?</question>
		<answer>Military advance pay: Advance payments provide you with funds to meet extraordinary expenses incident to a government-ordered relocation (PCS or a deployment for more than 365 days to an area subject to hostile fire/imminent danger pay). It is intended to assist with the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in a duty location change, and the expenses not typical of day-to-day military living. An advance of pay will not be authorized for the specific out-of-pocket expenses covered by advances of other pays and allowances.
Housing advance: You may request a housing advance to pay advance rent, security deposits, and /or initial expenses incident to occupying non-government housing. It is intended to assist with the out-of-pocket expenses that exceed or precede reimbursements incurred in a duty location change, and the expenses not typical of day-to-day military living. An advance of pay will not be authorized for the specific out-of-pocket expenses covered by advances of other pays and allowances.
Active Duty: To electronically complete an advance request of pay, BAH, or OHA, please use eFinance

		<question>When do I need a commander's signature to receive my partial/casual/advance payment?</question>
		<answer>Partial/casual payments vary on a case-by-case basis, and you should see your Finance Office for more information regarding your particular situation.
Your commander's signature is required on the DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form) to authorize payment of a PCS advance if you are an E-3 or below, regardless of the amount requested. Anyone requesting more than a 12 month payback schedule or more than one month's pay will also need a commander's signature on advance PCS payments.
All personnel are required to obtain their commander's signature on the AF Form 1039 (Request to Receive and/or Extend Repayment of an Advance Housing Allowance) to receive a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) advance for extraordinary expenses in obtaining or occupying other than government housing.
AF Form 1039 is available at your Housing Office or Finance Office.
Authorized partial and casual payments may be made only under extremely extenuating circumstances or due to an emergency. Partial/casual payments are subject to your local Finance office policy which may or may not require the commander's approval.

		<question>Is my bonus tax exempt?</question>
		<answer>Bonuses earned in a Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) area are tax exempt up to the maximum allowable amount.
If you are enlisted, there is no maximum amount. If you are an officer, your maximum monthly exemption is limited to the highest rate of enlisted basic pay plus the amount of Hostile Fire Pay / Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) due to you for that month.  Currently, that exemption is $7,834.50 monthly (CMSAF monthly basic pay of $7,609.50 plus amount of HFP/IDP payable during the month, not to exceed $225.00).  Any amount in excess of that total will be taxed.  If you are an officer, keep in mind that your normal basic pay also counts against your maximum exemption, as well as any bonus.

The career status bonus (CSB) is tax exempt only if the effective date of your election falls within a month when you are entitled to CZTE. CSB does not apply to Reserve.

		<question>Why do I have an 'advance debt' amount on my Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)?</question>
		<answer>The advance debt line on your LES is an amount given to offset the immediate collection of an overpayment. It is generated by the pay system when an entitlement/allowance is adjusted retroactively. The result is a debt you are required to repay; contact your servicing Finance Office for more details and debt repayment options.
For Reservists, an advance debt is only applicable to long tours (30 days or more).

		<question>How do I contribute, and how much can I contribute, to the Savings Deposit Program (SDP)?</question>
		<answer>You can make contributions at your deployed location by cash or check.  In addition, active duty members can make deposits by allotment. Your deployed Finance Office will be able to assist with cash deposits or allotments to SDP.
The maximum that you can contribute to SDP at one time is your un-allotted pay and allowances.  Your un-allotted pay and allowances is the amount of money you are entitled to receive on payday minus your authorized deductions and allotments. Pay and allowances include special continuation pay, reenlistment bonuses, travel allowance on discharge and pay for unused accrued leave. You may combine pay accrued from one payday with pay accrued from the following payday to make one deposit as long as that deposit does not exceed what you are entitled to be paid for a one month period.
NOTE: Although there is no limit on the amount you can contribute to SDP, only amounts up to $10,000 will accrue interest at a rate of 10 percent per year.

		<question>Can I get Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for my dependent(s) if I am living in the dorms?</question>
		<answer>Your entitlement, if any, will depend on the circumstances.  If you are living in the dorm and paying child support you may be entitled to receive BAH-Differential (DIFF) if the amount of child support you pay is equal to or greater than the BAH-Differential rate.  BAH-Differential rates are in a table along with BAH transit and BAH partial rates.  Follow the BAH Non-Locality Rates link to the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) website.  In the Non-Locality BAH folder select the file for the current year's non-locality BAH rates. 
In other circumstances such as when you are on a dependent restricted tour (e.g. Osan AB) or assigned to a location where dependent travel is restricted (e.g. pipeline student), you will continue to draw BAH at the with dependent rate based on your authorized dependent's location.  Follow the BAH Rates link to determine the amount of your BAH at the with dependent rate.

		<question>How do I start and stop Hardship Duty Pay (HDP)?</question>
		<answer>If you requested HDP to be started before you departed, you should see it in your Leave and Earning Statement (LES) within 30 days of your arrival. If you don't request it prior to departure, you can request it at the deployed Finance Office during your deployment. You can also wait until you return to your home station to file for HDP. Your settlement travel voucher is also used to stop the entitlement.

If you travel to different locations within the deployed Area of Responsibility (AOR) or between AORs, your HDP rate will be adjusted accordingly when you file your travel settlement voucher, but you can contact the deployed Finance Office if you want it adjusted prior to your return.

		<question>Can I set up my Family Separation Allowance (FSA) to begin before I depart on TDY, or do I have to wait until I return?</question>
		<answer>If your TDY orders are for more than 30 days, you should go to your Finance Office before you depart to get FSA started. You will need to provide a copy of your orders and a DD Form 1561 (Statement to Substantiate Payment of Family Separation Allowance) to the Finance Office.

You will receive FSA in your paychecks after you have been separated from your dependents for over 30 days.  However, the effective date of your FSA will be retroactive to the date you departed. You will continue to receive FSA until you return to your PDS and file your travel voucher provided your dependents do not reside at or near the TDY location nor visit for more than 30 days.
To file a claim after completion of your TDY for FSA, please use eFinance.

		<question>How much Family Separation Allowance (FSA) will I receive for TDY?</question>
		<answer>FSA is payable at the rate of $250.00 per month and prorated to $8.33 per day for partial months. To receive FSA II, type T (TDY), you must be TDY at least 31 consecutive days and your dependents cannot reside at or near the TDY location nor visit for more than 30 days.

For example, if you are TDY from 12 May 2007 to 24 June 2007, then you are eligible to receive FSA from the day you departed from your PDS to the day before you arrive back at your PDS. Your total days eligible to receive FSA would be 42 days (since FSA is computed on a 30 day month, the 31st of May is not eligible for payment).

		<question>Will I be reimbursed for hotel stays while traveling to my new PDS?</question>
		<answer>This will depend on the mode of travel.
Generally speaking, lodging is not reimbursed while traveling by Privately Owned Vehicle (POV). However, you do receive what is known as Monetary Allowance in Lieu of Transportation (MALT Plus), which is a flat rate allowance and mileage. $JFTR_Chap_5_Part_A_Para_5026 has more information on MALT Plus.
For air travel, lodging is entitled based on the hotel's single room rate, at the ports in and out of a CONUS/OCONUS location.
For ferry travel, you are authorized to lodging at the ports on and off of the ferry. MALT Plus is also payable for the driving portions to and from the ferry ports.

If you were authorized to lodge off base, you will receive the full per diem rate for meals, and will be reimbursed your actual lodging cost not to exceed the max lodging rate.
The per diem rates for lodging and meals vary by location. The available link Per Diem Rates will take you to the per diem rates for CONUS and OCONUS.

		<question>Am I entitled to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) while occupying government quarters?</question>
		<answer>Generally, you are not entitled to receive BAH (or Overseas Housing Allowance - OHA) while occupying permanent government family-type (i.e. base housing) or single-type (i.e. dormitory) housing. You may be entitled to BAH if your dependents do not occupy family-type government quarters or you are living in privatized government housing.
To avoid a potential overpayment, please contact your servicing Finance Office if you have been assigned permanent government quarters and your BAH or OHA has not yet stopped.

		<question>How often does my Family Separation Housing - Overseas housing allowance based location (FSH-O) change?</question>

OHA changes whenever there is a change in your location's adequate lodging costs, a change in your housing expenses, or a change in the your pay grade. There is no set schedule for these changes. Note, FSH-O stop on the day your lease terminates if prior to the day before your PCS departure.</answer>

		<question>I arrived PCS on a holiday weekend and could not sign in. Will I be charged leave for the weekend and holiday?</question>
		<answer>Your sign in date to your new PDS will be determined by the day you notify your unit of your availability for duty. Leave will be calculated based on your departure date from your old PDS and your sign in date to your new PDS minus allowable travel time.
Examples:
Member arrives at Peterson AFB, CO on Friday and checks into billeting and calls his/her supervisor. Member reports to duty section Monday morning. Sign in date is Friday.
Member arrives at F.E. Warren AFB, WY on Friday and checks into billeting. Member does not contact his/her supervisor and reports to duty on Monday morning. Sign in date is Monday.
Be sure to contact your new Unit as soon as you arrive in the local area, even if it is a non-duty day, to avoid being charged any extra days of leave.

		<question>Why didn't I receive my Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP)?</question>
		<answer>There could be several reasons why you did not receive your HFP/IDP. If you are concerned that it isn't reflected in your paycheck, first make sure you have allowed for sufficient processing time (usually two pay periods).
Your HFP/IDP can be started before you leave for your deployment, during your deployment, or paid upon your return.  In all three cases, it is posted to your pay account based on a copy of your orders or settled travel voucher. Once the HFP/IDP is posted, it will apply to your next regular paycheck. This may take a couple of pay periods to show up due to payroll cut-off dates.

If you waited until your return, please allow five business days for your voucher to process and another 30 days (or two pay periods) for HFP/IDP to reflect in your paycheck. 
If you still have questions you will need to contact your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>As a Reservist, how does Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) work when I move into privatized housing?</question>
		<answer>You will receive your standard BAH rate (determined by your rank, location and dependency status) while occupying privatized housing. As a Reservist you cannot set up an allotment, so you are required to make arrangements with the Housing Office to pay your rent at the rate of your BAH minus 110% of the approved average utility calculation. You will receive BAH for any tour over 30 days (PCS or TDY) regardless of whether or not you are in privatized housing.

Depending on your personal utility consumption, your total monthly expenses (rent and utilities) may or may not exceed your BAH.

		<question>How much will I earn on my Savings Deposit Program (SDP) contribution(s), and for how long?</question>
		<answer>If your amount on deposit is less than $10,000, interest at the rate of 10 percent per year is compounded quarterly. Once $10,000 is on deposit, simple interest is computed on the $10,000 only.  No interest is paid on amounts exceeding $10,000, except on amounts for a member who is in a missing status.
Your deposits stop accruing interest 90 days after your eligibility to make SDP deposits terminates (i.e. when you leave the authorized SDP contribution area). If no withdrawal is made within 120 days, DFAS will automatically transfer the funds to your military pay account.

		<question>As a Reservist, how often can I receive military clothing allowance?</question>
		<answer>For Enlisted Reservists:
Generally, items of individual clothing required by Reserve Component personnel on Active Duty for periods of less than six months or while on Inactive Duty, are furnished as in kind issues. However, the prescribed cash portion of the standard initial clothing allowance may be paid at the time that your initial allowance is issued for items designated to be personally purchased and not issued in kind.
Reserve Officer:
A Reserve Officer is entitled to one initial military clothing allowance upon completion of 14 days of active duty or 14 inactive duty periods. Officers who are on orders for more than 90 days may be authorized to additional Officer uniform allowance. This allowance is not payable when the tour of duty for which payment is being considered began within 2 years after the end of a previous period of active duty, or active duty for training, of more than 90 days. This applies whether or not a uniform allowance was paid for the previous tour of duty.

		<question>When will my housing allowance change to reflect my new duty location?</question>
		<answer>Generally, for members with dependents, if you are assigned to a base in the CONUS, Alaska or Hawaii, your entitlement to basic allowance for housing (BAH) for your PDS location is effective on the day you arrive at your base. If you are assigned to an overseas station, you must first obtain a rental or lease agreement after arrival before you are entitled to be paid overseas housing allowance (OHA). 
Of course, if you're assigned to family housing, you will not receive a housing allowance.

		<question>What travel and transportation allowances am I entitled to while serving an Indeterminate TDY (ITDY)?</question>
		<answer>Please note, for 365-day extended deployments, with return to your PDS, the following ITDY entitlements do not apply.
En route to the ITDY location or prior to departure to the ITDY location:
You are entitled to dependent travel and transportation at government expense to an alternate place to establish a permanent residence during your ITDY.
You are also entitled to PCS travel and transportation allowances for your travel to accompany your dependents to the alternate place, only if your presence is needed to assist your dependents in relocating (not for personal convenience).

		<question>How does the advance pay process/request work?</question>
		<answer>Advance pay is intended to assist with out-of-pocket expenses that exceed or precede reimbursements incurred in a duty location change, and are expenses that are not typical of day-to-day military living. Advance pay is only authorized in the event of a PCS move or a deployment for more than 365 days to an area subject to hostile fire/imminent danger pay. PCS moves from OCONUS to CONUS for the purpose of separation or retirement are not authorized PCS advance pay.
The amount of advance pay that you may receive is limited to a maximum amount of three month's basic pay less deductions. Advance pay, once approved, will be electronically deposited into your bank account.
Requests for advance pay are documented on a DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form).
Your unit Commander is the approval authority for advance pay in the following circumstances:
You are in pay grades E-1 through E-3 regardless of amount or repayment schedule.
You are in a pay grade of E-4 or higher and:
Amount requested is more than one month's base pay less deductions
Repayment is requested for more than 12 months
Payment is requested between 30 and 90 days of PCS departure or 60 to 180 days after PCS arrival
Normally, it is only under extenuating circumstances that a commander will approve you to receive your advance 90 days prior to, or within 180 days after you PCS
In all other circumstances your signature is all that is required
Bring your completed DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form), along with a copy of your PCS orders, to your local Finance Office.
When requesting an overseas housing allowance (OHA), it must be approved by the unit commander and the housing officer.  You must show proof of expenses before you can receive a housing advance to include copy of your lease, utility statements, and any other pertinent documentation.  Normally, an advance housing allowance may not be paid more than three workdays prior to you being required to make a payment under a lease or payment plan.
Repayment will typically be made within 12 months, beginning in the month after receipt of the advance. For example, if you receive a $1,200 advance pay in June, the repayment will begin in July. In this example your repayment amount would $100 per month ($1,200 divided by 12 months equals $100 per month), or $50 per pay period if you get paid twice per month.
Alternatively, you may use eFinance to submit your advance pay request electronically.

		<question>What am I authorized for my dependents during a civilian PCS?</question>
		<answer>If your dependents travel with you, then any dependent 12 or over receives 75% of your allowance and dependents under 12 receive 50%.
If your spouse/domestic partner travels independently of you, then they are entitled to per diem equal to what you are authorized.  All other dependents will get per diem based on 75% of your per diem rate if they age 12 years or older, or 50% if they are younger than 12.
No travel or per diem allowances are authorized for your dependents at a TDY location en route to your new permanent duty station (PDS).

		<question>Why do I have an 'advance debt' amount on my Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)?</question>
		<answer>The advance debt line on your LES is an amount given to offset the immediate collection of an overpayment. It is generated by the pay system when an entitlement/allowance is adjusted retroactively. The result is a debt you are required to repay; contact your servicing Finance Office for more details and debt repayment options.
For Reservists, an advance debt is only applicable to long tours (30 days or more).

More than eight family members travel together by POV, including the member
Because of age or physical condition, a dependent needs special accommodations in one vehicle and second and third vehicles are required for more than five other family members
A member must report to a new duty station in advance of travel by dependents who delay travel for acceptable reasons (such as school term completion, property sale, settlement of personal business affairs, HHG transportation, non-availability of adequate housing at the new duty station) and more than four dependents travel by POV later
More than four dependents travel unaccompanied by POV between authorized points other than those for the member's travel (such as travel to/from a designated place without the member or to the new PDS when the member has TDY en route
More than four dependents travel unaccompanied to the new duty station in advance of the member's reporting date for acceptable reasons (such as to enroll children in school at the beginning of the term or secure housing)
More than six family members travel together by POV, including the member, over the Alcan Highway (safety guidelines require extra spare tires, parts, tools, etc.)
Special circumstances not included in listed above must be approved by Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC).

		<question>How is Dislocation Allowance (DLA) determined?</question>
		<answer>Factors that determine DLA:
DLA is determined by your rank and whether or not you have dependents (regardless of the number of dependents).
With Dependent Rate/Without Dependent Rate: 
In order to receive the "with-dependent" rate, your dependents must relocate. If you do not have dependents or if they do not relocate, you will receive the "without-dependent" rate. If you are E-4 or below and are not assigned government quarters, then you must have a signed statement by your Commander or designee stating that you were not assigned permanent government quarters.
Ineligibility for DLA:
If this is your final move due to separation or retirement, or you are single and resided in government quarters for more than 60 days after your arrival at your new PDS, then you are ineligible to receive DLA.

		<question>How many days am I authorized for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) when I PCS?</question>
		<answer>The number of days authorized for TLE when you PCS is based on where you're PCS'ing to and from:
OCONUS to CONUS (Overseas to Stateside): authorized 10 days at the new stateside base after arrival.
CONUS to OCONUS (Stateside to Overseas): authorized 5 days stateside at the old stateside PDS, prior to departure.
CONUS to CONUS (Stateside to Stateside): authorized 10 days (combined) at either stateside location.
OCONUS to OCONUS (Overseas to Overseas): TLE is a stateside allowance and not payable while lodging overseas. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) is payable instead.
If the number of days you actually occupy temporary lodging is less than what you are authorized, you will only be reimbursed for the actual days in lodging.
TLE is not authorized in conjunction with separation or retirement from active duty.

		<question>If I PCS to an accompanied location (CONUS or OCONUS), but my dependents don't move with me, am I still authorized Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) at my old PDS rate?</question>
		<answer>Normally, no. Your BAH is based on your permanent duty station (PDS) location. However, there are circumstances where you may be authorized to receive a BAH at the old PDS rate. Examples of these circumstances include:
You are assigned to a PDS in an area in which sufficient housing quantities do not exist
You are assigned to indeterminate Temporary Duty (TDY), or TDY pending further orders
You are assigned to a Professional Military Education (PME) or a training course that is scheduled for the duration of one year or less.
In order to receive a BAH rate, other than the PDS location, you must apply through your local Military Personnel Flight.

You may receive BAH based on your old station rate in situations where you are making a PCS move to an overseas location where your dependents are restricted, and your dependents are residing separately from you. If your dependents relocate to a designated place, the BAH rate will be based on that location.
To make changes to your BAH, please use eFinance.

		<question>How do I stop the Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) I've been receiving while I was deployed?</question>
		<answer>HFP/IDP is stopped when you file your final settlement travel voucher. If you have noticed that the entitlement has not stopped, and you have received payment for your travel voucher, please contact your local Finance Office. This entitlement may also be stopped by your deployed location Finance Office.
Hostile fire pay is payable for the entire month in which you accrued the entitlement.  However, imminent danger pay is prorated daily and paid based on the number of days you performed duty in the designated area. 
To file your travel settlement voucher, please use Defense Travel System (DTS) or eFinance, as applicable.
Reservists - HFP/IDP is stopped when you submit a copy of your final settlement travel voucher to your servicing Finance Office upon return from TDY.

		<question>How do I contribute, and how much can I contribute, to the Savings Deposit Program (SDP)?</question>
		<answer>You can make contributions at your deployed location by cash or check.  In addition, active duty members can make deposits by allotment. Your deployed Finance Office will be able to assist with cash deposits or allotments to SDP.
The maximum that you can contribute to SDP at one time is your un-allotted pay and allowances.  Your un-allotted pay and allowances is the amount of money you are entitled to receive on payday minus your authorized deductions and allotments. Pay and allowances include special continuation pay, reenlistment bonuses, travel allowance on discharge and pay for unused accrued leave. You may combine pay accrued from one payday with pay accrued from the following payday to make one deposit as long as that deposit does not exceed what you are entitled to be paid for a one month period.
NOTE: Although there is no limit on the amount you can contribute to SDP, only amounts up to $10,000 will accrue interest at a rate of 10 percent per year.

		<question>How do I start or stop an allotment?</question>
		<answer>For active duty members, you can start, stop and change allotments to financial institutions using the myPay web site. Allotments to pay for insurance premiums, privatized housing rent, and home mortgage payments can be started, stopped and changed using the eFinance application. If your allotment can't be processed on myPay or eFinance, you can complete a DD Form 2558 (Authorization to Start Stop or Change an Allotment) and submit it to your servicing Finance Office for processing.

Civilian employees can also start, stop or change allotments to financial institutions using the myPay web site. For all other allotment processing such as charity, union dues, or insurance, employees need to contact their local customer service representative (CSR). You can visit the myPay web site to change, stop, and start an allotment.

Active duty members and civilian employees who want to purchase savings bonds by payroll deduction need to first establish an account at Treasury Direct Website.  After you establish your account, you will need your account number and the Treasury Direct routing number to start an allotment via myPay to Treasury Direct for purchasing your bonds.

		<question>What avenues can I use to get my accrual processed?</question>
		<answer>You may start the accrual payment process prior to departure by visiting your servicing Finance Office. Simply fill out the accrual form and submit it with a copy of your orders.

If you did not set up the accruals before departing TDY, you can either use eFinance or vMPF to request your accrual.

If you do not have access to the AF Portal you can visit the Finance Office at your TDY or deployed location and they will assist you in preparing the proper documentation to be submitted to the AFFSC for processing.

If there is no Finance Office where you're TDY, you will need to reach back to your home station Finance Office for assistance.

		<question>What do I need to start my Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP)?</question>
		<answer>Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) entitlements are started by the deployed Finance Office once you in-process at your deployed location. If you have already in-processed and you are not receiving HFP/IDP, you will need to notify the deployed Finance Office. The only documentation required is a copy of your orders.

Depending on the date you in-process, you may not see the entitlement reflected in your pay until the following month.  However, the entitlement is retroactive to your arrival.  For imminent danger pay, the entitlement will be prorated based on your date of arrival in the designated area.  Hostile fire pay is paid for the entire month in which you earned it, without proration.
Reservists - You need to provide your servicing Finance Office a copy of your orders directing you to the qualifying area and your projected date in country.

		<question>Is it cheaper to fly or drive for my TDY or PCS?</question>
		<answer>TDY:
Your orders approving official (AO) will determine if driving your Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) is advantageous to the government or not. If your orders approving official authorizes you to drive, then you will be authorized mileage, tolls, ferry fees, and per diem for driving. If your orders are not advantageous to the government, you will be reimbursed for your actual method of travel, not to exceed the constructed cost of government procured common carrier transportation (i.e. commercial air).  The current mileage rate for using your POV on a TDY is $0.575 per mile.
PCS:
Using your POV on your PCS, other than for transoceanic travel, is always considered advantageous to the government.  You may elect to travel by POV, common carrier, or be provided transportation in kind (at no charge).  If you use your POV, you will be reimbursed $0.23 per mile, per authorized vehicle

		<question>Why is my Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) different from the amount I expected?</question>
		<answer>There are several reasons why your bonus payment may be different than the amount on your contract:
Bonuses may be paid in installments - an initial payment of 50% is made on the effective date of the reenlistment, and then anniversary payments are split evenly and paid on the anniversary date for the enlistment period. You do not receive the full bonus in one lump sum payment.
All bonus payments are taxed at 25% by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in addition to any applicable state tax. Taxes are deducted from the bonus amount when paid to you.
If you elected to contribute any part of your bonus to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), that deduction was subtracted from the bonus payment.
You may have reenlisted in a Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) location, in which case your bonus would be paid tax free.
For further information contact your servicing Personnel Office.

		<question>How are my authorized travel days determined?</question>
		<answer>Your authorized travel days are determined by mode of transportation. Your Approving Official (AO) will designate which mode of transportation you are authorized/directed to use on your TDY orders/authorization.
Generally, if you travel via government procured air transportation (you make arrangements through your local contract ticket office or CTO), you are authorized your actual travel time, via the most direct route, to get to your TDY destination.
If you elect to travel via a mode of travel not authorized/directed by your AO, then you will be limited to your actual travel time not to exceed the travel time for the directed mode. This includes travel by privately owned conveyance (POC) not advantageous to the government.
For travel by POC designated as advantageous to the government, you are authorized 1 travel day for each 400 miles of official distance; any remainder after dividing the total distance by 400 will result in an additional travel day.

		<question>When will I receive my Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB)?</question>
		<answer>Bonus payments are usually deposited in your bank account within three to five days after your reenlistment paperwork has been received and verified by your Finance Office. 
Generally, your bonus will be a separate deposit and will not be included in your paycheck.  However, it will be deposited into the same account as your regular pay. 
The initial payment, 50% of the SRB, will be released to your bank once the Finance Office has verified you did in fact reenlist and that a bonus was authorized. This means that you must provide reenlistment paperwork to your Finance Office. This should occur on the actual date of reenlistment.  If you are away from your PDS on your reenlistment date, the signed documentation can be sent from the MPF to your finance office.  Future installments will be automatically released to your bank account on the anniversary date of your reenlistment.
Payments are made separately from your regular pay and are electronically deposited into your direct deposit bank account.

		<question>When I deploy, what happens to my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contributions?</question>
		<answer>When you contribute to the TSP while serving in a Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) area, you will not receive a direct tax benefit from those contributions because they have been excluded from your gross income. However, the contributions are designated as tax exempt and earnings on those contributions remain exempt too.
When you make a withdrawal from your TSP account, money is taken from your total account balance in proportion from your taxable funds and your tax-exempt funds. The amount attributable to tax-exempt contributions will not be taxable.

The TSP will account for your tax-exempt contributions and will ensure that these amounts are not reported to the IRS as taxable income. Consequently, those contributions will not be subject to taxation when you withdraw them. Your quarterly participant statement will show your tax-exempt balance separately.
Go to the Thrift Savings Plan Website for further information.

		<question>Which items of pay are subject to federal taxation?</question>
		<answer>Military pays are considered taxable wages as defined by the DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 44 (Withholding of Income Tax) and are subject to federal and state income tax withholding. Examples of taxable items of pay include basic pay and incentive pays, such as flight pay. In addition to income taxes, basic pay only is subject to deduction for the Social Security and Medicare tax. 
Generally, allowances are not taxable. Examples of non-taxable allowances include Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), and Family Separation Allowance (FSA). A notable exception is CONUS Cost of Living Allowance (C COLA), which is subject to withholding for federal and state tax.

		<question>Am I eligible for a Dislocation Allowance (DLA)?</question>
		<answer>Your eligibility for DLA depends on your individual situation. If you have dependents, you are normally authorized DLA at the with-dependent rate when your dependents relocate in conjunction with a PCS. In other circumstances, you may be entitled to DLA when your dependents move in conjunction with closure or realignment of a military installation or move to a designated location as a result of an evacuation.
If you are a member without dependents, you may be authorized DLA at the without-dependent rate when you relocate to a base where you are not assigned to government quarters or when you move in conjunction with closure or realignment of a military installation.
The amount of your DLA is based on your dependency status and pay grade and is normally paid when your PCS travel voucher is paid.  Click on the following link to check DLA Rates. If you still have questions about your eligibility for DLA, please contact your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>When will my last payment be made to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?</question>
		<answer>Military:  Your last TSP contribution will be taken out of your pay the month prior to your Date of Separation (DOS).  If you would like your TSP contribution to be withheld during your final month of active duty, contact your servicing Finance Office prior to your final month of active duty so they can process the request.  For example, if you separate in May, your last TSP payment will be made in April, unless you submit a request to your Finance Office to have TSP deducted and paid during your DOS month. 
Civilian:  Your TSP contributions will continue all the way to your last paycheck, unless you stop them sooner.
To change your withholding for TSP, please use myPay.
To change the allocation of your contributions between TSP funds, use the Thrift Savings Plan Website.

		<question>Will I be paid if I am nearing my expiration term of service (ETS) and my record does not reflect my reenlistment?</question>
		<answer>Yes, you will be paid. If your record has not been updated to reflect your reenlistment, and if you did not receive a paycheck or you are not projected to receive a paycheck, an emergency partial pay may be warranted.
Emergency partial payments must be authorized via letter from your Commander/First Sergeant stating the purpose for the payment.  Before going to your Finance Office, check with your Personnel Office to ensure they have all the required reenlistment paperwork.  If your personnel records are updated, proceed to your Finance Office.
Emergency partial payments are allowed up to the amount of accrued entitlements to date and are intended to prevent financial hardship. An emergency partial payment is a payment deemed time sensitive due to an unforeseen set of circumstances that calls for immediate action. Emergency partial payments are made in an expedited manner via EFT.

		<answer>You can claim exemption from withholding if you had no tax liability in the previous year and anticipate no tax liability in the current year. Claim the exemption by completing the W-4 Form, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, and submitting it to your Finance Office. The exemption is only good for the current calendar year and you need to file a new W-4 each year if you continue to remain exempt. If something changes and you determine that you will have a tax liability in the current year, you need to file a new W-4.   </answer>

		<question>Is my entitlement to Hostile Fire Pay / Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) pro-rated?</question>
		<answer>Until 31 December 2011, Hostile Fire Pay (HFP) and Imminent Danger Pay (IDP) were both paid at the full monthly rate and not prorated.  However, effective 31 December 2011, a change in the law required IDP to be paid on a prorated basis, based on the number of days you perform duty in one of the designated areas.  For example, if you perform duty in an IDP area for 10 days in a month, you will only be paid IDP for 10 days. 
HFP continues to be paid on a monthly basis. In other words, if you meet the criteria on any day in the month, you'll be paid HFP for the entire month.  
Also note below the special circumstances in which HFP, as well as IDP are prorated:
You are subject to a total forfeiture of pay and allowances, or 
You are in an excess leave status, or 
Your entitlement to HFP/IDP is earned during the month you enter active duty, or 
Your entitlement to HFP/IDP is earned during the month you separate from service.
The current rate for HFP and IDP is $225 per month.

		<question>How is Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) computed?</question>
		<answer>There are several steps involved in computing TLE. Below is the computation for the most common scenario. See the link below for computation questions related to your specific situation.
Step 1: Determine the applicable M&IE and lodging locality per diem rates for your location. The applicable M&IE and lodging locality per diem rates can be found at the link below.

Step 2: Determine your applicable per diem percentage. Using the table below, calculate the percentage you are allowed to claim based on your specific situation.
 Number of Eligible Persons Occupying Temporary Quarters         Percentage Applicable
 Member or 1 dependent  65%
Member and 1 dependent, or 2 dependents only  100%
For each additional dependent age 12 and over add  35%
For each additional dependent under age 12 add  25%
For a member with multiple dependents occupying the same temporary lodging, add each dependent starting with the oldest dependent to get the correct percentage rate as shown above. A member with two dependents, one over 12 and one under 12, will have an applicable percentage of 125% since the member and dependent over 12 is 100%, and the additional dependent under 12 is 25%.

Step 3: Determine daily Meals & Incidental Expenses (M&IE) and ceiling for lodging. Multiply the appropriate percentage calculated in Step 2 by the applicable M&IE locality per diem rate and by the applicable lodging locality per diem rate determined in Step 1. This will give you your maximum allowed amount for both types of expenses.

Step 4: Determine lodging. Compare the actual daily lodging cost (including lodging taxes) to the lodging cost ceiling calculated in Step 3. The lesser of the two amounts is your authorized lodging expense.

Step 5: Determine gross daily equivalency. Add the lodging amount in Step 4 to the daily M&IE rate calculated in Step 3.

Step 6: Determine applicable daily rate. The standard TLE ceiling is currently $290. Per the JTR, TLE cannot exceed this amount. Compare $290 with the amount found in Step 5. You are authorized to claim the lesser of these two amounts for that specific day.

		<question>If I take leave in conjunction with a TDY, do I process my leave through LeaveWeb?</question>
		<answer>For non-DTS travel vouchers (manual vouchers prepared on a DD Form 1351-2 (Travel Voucher or Sub Voucher), or vouchers prepared using eFinance), you do not use LeaveWeb; your leave needs to be reflected on your travel settlement voucher and Finance will charge your leave off the travel voucher.
For DTS travel vouchers (orders and voucher prepared in the Defense Travel System (DTS)), you are required to use LeaveWeb or your time and attendance reporting system for any leave taken during your TDY. Additionally, you must enter your leave date(s) in your travel authorization/order's 'Per Diem Entitlements' section in DTS.

		<question>How does Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) work while I'm in a travel status?</question>
		<answer>While you are in travel status you will continue to receive BAH at the rate that applies to you.
If you are returning to the CONUS from the OCONUS, traveling PCS between OCONUS locations, or you are en route to your first duty station (other than a tech school) you will receive Basic Allowance for Housing -Transit rate (BAH-T or Non-Locality BAH) while in travel or leave status between Permanent Duty Stations provided you are not assigned Gov't quarters.
Go to BAH Non-Locality Rates link for current rates.  In the Non-Locality BAH folder select the file for the current year's non-locality BAH rates. 
If you are traveling from one CONUS PDS to another CONUS PDS, you will receive the BAH rate for your old PDS until the day prior to the day you in process at your new PDS, at which time you will receive BAH for the new CONUS PDS.

		<question>How much money do I have to give my spouse to constitute support for dependent Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)?</question>
		<answer>When you provide your dependent with the difference between your "with dependent" rate and the applicable single rate BAH for your grade, that constitutes support. Proof of support is usually not required unless there is evidence that support is not being provided or a complaint from the dependent for non-support arises.
If you are the non-custodial parent residing in single type government quarters and are paying child support, you will be authorized a flat rate of BAH called Basic Allowance for Housing-Difference (BAH-DIFF). The amount of child support you provide must be equal to or greater than the flat rate of BAH-DIFF. If the child support is lower than the BAH-DIFF, you will not be provided the allowance.

		<question>When my "IMA-Category" changed from 24 to 48 periods, why did I not receive the points or pay?</question>
		<answer>When you change pay categories, for example B to A, the number of paid Inactive Duty Training (IDT)/ Unit Training Assembly (UTA) allowed during that Fiscal Year (FY) may be prorated to something between 24 and 48 periods. You should consult your local Base IMA Administrator (BIMAA) to determine what your maximum for the year is. Beginning the next FY, the maximum number of paid IDTs/UTAs will automatically re-set to the actual number allowed for your category.
Another reason why you did not receive points or pay may be that your AF Form 40A (Record of Individual Inactive Duty Training) was processed incorrectly or missed a payroll cut-off and you will be paid on the next available payroll.

Your local BIMAA is your best point of contact for concerns.

		<question>When will my promotion/demotion be reflected in my paycheck?</question>
		<answer>Active Duty:
Promotions and demotions are generally reflected in the paycheck following the promotion/demotion. All promotions and demotions are processed by the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and a transaction is sent to DFAS to update your pay.  For example, if your promotion is effective on the first of the month, this will normally be reflected in your pay on the 15th of the month.  As another example, assume that your promotion or demotion is effective on the 10th of the month.  The effective date is after the processing deadline for the 15th payday, so you should expect the change to be reflected in your end-of-month pay. 

Reserve:
Promotions and demotions are generally reflected in the paycheck following the promotion/demotion.  Enlisted promotions and demotions are processed by your servicing Personnel Office. Officer promotions and demotions are processed by the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC).  In both cases, the transactions are sent to DFAS to update your pay.

		<question>What is my new basic pay rate?</question>
		<answer>Your new basic pay rate will take effect on the day that you are promoted, demoted, or due your longevity pay increase. If that day falls on any day other than the first of the month, your basic pay rate will be a mix between the old and new base pay rates for that month, followed by the new base pay rate thereafter. For example, if you are promoted, demoted or due a longevity increase on the 10th of the month, the first 9 days of the month will be at the old rate while the rest of the days in that month will be at the new rate.

To determine the amount of basic pay for the month of promotion, demotion or longevity, take both the old and new basic pay rates and divide them by 30. Take the resulting figures and multiply them for the number of days in the month that they apply. Regardless of actual days in a month, always use 30 days for your calculation. Remember, the day you are promoted, demoted or due a longevity increase is paid at the new basic pay rate.

		<question>When I PCS, what per diem allowances are my dependents eligible for?</question>
		<answer>Your dependent's per diem allowance is based off your allowance as the uniformed member.
For travel by Privately Owned Conveyance (POC), your per diem is at the flat standard CONUS rate.
For travel by commercial means, your per diem is at the rate for the new PDS or the rate for the delay point if you stop overnight. You are not authorized per diem for delays of leave or personal reasons.
Per diem for the dependents is 3/4 of the member's applicable rate for each dependent age 12 or older and 1/2 of the member's rate for each dependent under age 12.
If your spouse or designated child (age 12 and over) travels separately from you, they will be authorized to the same rate of per diem as you, not the reduced rate. Other dependents traveling with them would be factored the same as if they were with you.
Go to Per Diem Rates for more information.
Additionally, your dependent will be authorized mileage if traveling by POC. Mileage is a flat rate for each POC used by authorized travelers. If you use more than two POCs, then you must obtain special authorization through your servicing Personnel Office in order to be reimbursed. Mileage can be found in JTR Chap 2 Part I Para 2605 (MALT Rate).

		<question>How will my bonus payment be taxed?</question>
		<answer>Your bonus will be taxed at 25% for federal income tax withholding (FITW).  The amount of state income tax withholding (SITW) varies depending on the state of legal residence you claim for tax purposes.  However, if you earn your bonus (reenlist, extend, or sign agreement) in a month when you are entitled to the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE), your bonus and future installments are not taxed. If you are an officer and are due a bonus that was earned in a CZTE area, your tax exclusion for the bonus is limited to the highest rate of basic pay for an enlisted member plus the amount of hostile fire pay payable to you during that month.     </answer>

		<question>How many days am I authorized PCS Travel?</question>
		<answer>Generally, one travel day is allowed for each 400 miles of official distance of ordered travel. If you take the total miles driven and divide it by 400 and the excess distance is 1 or more miles after dividing the total official distance by 400, one additional travel day is allowed. When the total official distance is 400 or fewer miles, only one day of travel time is allowed.
For common carrier transportation, actual travel time for the direct route is authorized, normally one day.

		<question>How much leave can I take enroute on my TDY or PCS?</question>

		<question>Does my BAH/OHA change when my child turns 18 or 21?</question>
		<answer>If your sole unmarried dependent for BAH/OHA purposes turns 21 years old, with-dependent rate BAH/OHA stops the day before the child's 21st birthday. However, if your sole dependent child is a full time student, payment of with-dependent rate continues until the child's 23rd birthday provided your child is dependent upon you for over 1/2 of their support.
Additionally, a child that is incapacitated and over the age of 21 may qualify as a dependent for BAH/OHA purposes, subject to a secondary dependency determination. Please contact your local finance office for more details.

		<question>Can I get Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for my dependent(s) if I am living in the dorms?</question>
		<answer>Your entitlement, if any, will depend on the circumstances.  If you are living in the dorm and paying child support you may be entitled to receive BAH-Differential (DIFF) if the amount of child support you pay is equal to or greater than the BAH-Differential rate.  BAH-Differential rates are in a table along with BAH transit and BAH partial rates.  Follow the BAH Non-Locality Rates link to the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) website.  In the Non-Locality BAH folder select the file for the current year's non-locality BAH rates. 
In other circumstances such as when you are on a dependent restricted tour (e.g. Osan AB) or assigned to a location where dependent travel is restricted (e.g. pipeline student), you will continue to draw BAH at the with dependent rate based on your authorized dependent's location.  Follow the BAH Rates link to determine the amount of your BAH at the with dependent rate.

		<question>How does the advance pay process/request work?</question>
		<answer>Advance pay is intended to assist with out-of-pocket expenses that exceed or precede reimbursements incurred in a duty location change, and are expenses that are not typical of day-to-day military living. Advance pay is only authorized in the event of a PCS move or a deployment for more than 365 days to an area subject to hostile fire/imminent danger pay. PCS moves from OCONUS to CONUS for the purpose of separation or retirement are not authorized PCS advance pay.
The amount of advance pay that you may receive is limited to a maximum amount of three month's basic pay less deductions. Advance pay, once approved, will be electronically deposited into your bank account.
Requests for advance pay are documented on a DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form).
Your unit Commander is the approval authority for advance pay in the following circumstances:
You are in pay grades E-1 through E-3 regardless of amount or repayment schedule.
You are in a pay grade of E-4 or higher and:
Amount requested is more than one month's base pay less deductions
Repayment is requested for more than 12 months
Payment is requested between 30 and 90 days of PCS departure or 60 to 180 days after PCS arrival
Normally, it is only under extenuating circumstances that a commander will approve you to receive your advance 90 days prior to, or within 180 days after you PCS
In all other circumstances your signature is all that is required
Bring your completed DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form), along with a copy of your PCS orders, to your local Finance Office.
When requesting an overseas housing allowance (OHA), it must be approved by the unit commander and the housing officer.  You must show proof of expenses before you can receive a housing advance to include copy of your lease, utility statements, and any other pertinent documentation.  Normally, an advance housing allowance may not be paid more than three workdays prior to you being required to make a payment under a lease or payment plan.
Repayment will typically be made within 12 months, beginning in the month after receipt of the advance. For example, if you receive a $1,200 advance pay in June, the repayment will begin in July. In this example your repayment amount would $100 per month ($1,200 divided by 12 months equals $100 per month), or $50 per pay period if you get paid twice per month.
Alternatively, you may use eFinance to submit your advance pay request electronically.

		<question>What is an authorized charge on my Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC)?</question>
		<answer>Generally, the card may only be used for expenses that will be reimbursed to you for your official travel, such as airline costs, lodging, meals, and rental cars, when authorized. The card may also be used for some non reimbursable incidental travel expenses such as rental movies, exercise fees and beverages, when these charges are part of a room billing or meal cost and are reasonable. Remember that not all authorized charges on your GTCC may be reimbursable.  

Your GTCC may also be used when you incur expenses during leave in conjunction with a TDY when the charges are an integral part of the billing for the entire period at the TDY location. For example, if you are authorized leave at a TDY location before or after the TDY, and your room or car rental is continued into the TDY period, you could use your card for the rental car or lodging costs during the leave period. Those expenses are not reimbursable to you and you are responsible to pay those costs to the card issuer.

If in doubt, do not charge the expense to your GTCC.  For additional clarification, please see your unit's Agency Program Coordinator (APC) or reference DODFMR Vol 9 Chap 3 (DoD Government Travel Charge Card).

		<question>What kind of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) do I receive while enroute PCS and what is it based on?</question>
		<answer>The BAH rate you receive while enroute PCS depends on the location of your losing permanent duty station (PDS) and your grade and dependency status. If your losing station is in the US (CONUS and Alaska or Hawaii), you receive BAH at the rate for the losing station through the day prior to date of arrival at the new PDS. If your losing station is overseas, and your dependents were with you in the overseas location, you receive BAH Transit (BAH-T) through the day prior to date of arrival at the new PDS. If you were receiving BAH for dependents while you were overseas, that BAH rate continues through the day prior to date of arrival at the new PDS.</answer>

		<question>What are my PCS travel allowances?</question>
		<answer>Per diem: You are authorized 100% of the standard CONUS per diem rate (currently $123), which includes Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE). You are also authorized Lodging Plus for flying and TDY, and/or MALT Plus for POC Travel.  Applicable M&IE, Lodging Plus, and MALT Plus are multiplied by the number of actual travel days not to exceed the authorized travel days. Your spouse and each child 12 or over are authorized 75% of your allowances, and each child under 12 is authorized 50% of your allowance. If your driving involves OCONUS locations, your per diem rate would be the OCONUS locality rate.
PCS allowances while flying: Your per diem will be based on the locality rate of your gaining PDS or authorized stop over point. You will get per diem for the actual travel time used, not to include any travel for leave. Normally, for travel in CONUS, one travel day is allowed for travel by air. Your spouse and children 12 and over are authorized 75% of your per diem allowance; children under 12 are authorized 50% of your per diem allowance.

If you purchase your own airfare, you will be reimbursed not to exceed the cost of government procured tickets for the official travel. NOTE: You cannot purchase transoceanic or non-US carrier airfare for your own transportation; any transoceanic or OCONUS travel arrangements must be made through your servicing Transportation Management Office (TMO).  
Listed below is a general description of PCS travel and transportation allowances. Actual allowances depend on your individual travel circumstances. 
Member and Dependent Travel and Transportation Allowances: When you travel under a PCS order, the government either furnishes transportation, reimbursement, or a payment in lieu of transportation at rates found at the per diem link below. 
Generally, you select the transportation mode (i.e., airplane, train, bus, POC) for travel between the old and new Permanent Duty Stations (PDS).
House Hold Goods (HHG) Transportation and Storage: You are authorized HHG transportation and/or storage. Actual weight allowance will depend on your grade and dependency status. Traffic Management Office (TMO) can provide weight allowances.
POV Transportation: If you are ordered to make a PCS to, from, or between OCONUS PDSs, you may be authorized to have one POV, transported to the vehicle processing center serving the member's new PDS or other authorized place. The POV must be for personal use by either you or your dependents.
Dislocation Allowance: DLA partially reimburses you for the relocation expenses of a PCS or evacuation. The rate is based on your grade and dependency status.
Rates are available at the DLA link below.
TLA: Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) partially offsets the added living expenses within OCONUS incurred by a member and dependents incident to a PCS. To estimate your TLA allowance, please use our TLA Calculator.
TLE Allowance: Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) allowance partially offsets the added living expenses within CONUS incurred by a member and dependents incident to a PCS. To estimate your TLE allowance, please use our TLE Calculator.


To file a PCS settlement voucher, please use the PCS In-Processing System (PIPS).

		<question>How do I get a TDY advance?</question>
		<answer>TDY advance with a Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC):
The standard practice for receiving an advance is to use your GTCC at an ATM machine.
TDY advance without a GTCC:
If you do not have a GTCC, or your TDY location will not allow GTCC use, then you may go to your Finance Office and request an advance paid by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).

		<answer>You earn (accrue) 0.5 days of leave per every 6 days, or fraction thereof, with a maximum of 2.5 days per month.
For example, if you came on duty on 7 April, then you would accrue 2.0 days of leave for April (7th through the 30th of April is a total of 24 days, divided by 6 days = 4 "6 day periods" times 0.5 = 2.0 days of leave accrued).

		<question>Is my bonus tax-free if I was in a combat zone?</question>
		<answer>Bonuses earned in an area designated for the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) are tax exempt. For officers, the exemption is limited to the sum of the highest rate of enlisted basic pay plus the amount of Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) actually payable to the officer for the qualifying month. For enlisted members, there is no limit; the entire bonus is tax exempt.
If you're entitled to a Career Status Bonus (CSB), it is considered tax exempt if the effective date of your election falls within a month in which you're entitled to CZTE. 
CSB does not apply to the Reserve Component.

		<answer>Your Squadron will prepare your leave form(s) and your local Finance Office will verify your leave balance and assign the terminal leave and/or permissive TDY number(s).

If you PCS from OCONUS to a stateside permanent duty station (PDS) for the purpose of separation/retirement, the stateside Finance Office will assign the leave numbers.

If your permissive TDY is not taken in conjunction with your terminal leave, then your Unit will assign the leave number rather than the Finance Office.

		<question>Can I request a new survey for the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate in my area?</question>
		<answer>Published 05/24/2011 09:04 AM   |    Updated 03/05/2013 03:08 PM 
The BAH rates are determined by the Per Diem Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee (PDATAC). If you feel the rate in your area is insufficient you can request a new survey by following these steps:
Inform your Unit Commander
Your Unit Commander will then prepare a letter to the local Mission Support or Civil Engineering Commander requesting reconsideration
The letter is then routed to the Finance Office, MAJCOM, and on to:
AF/A1PA
1040 Air Force
Pentagon,
Washington, DC 20330-1040
with a cc to:
HQ AF/A7CAH,
1260 Air Force Pentagon,
Washington DC 20330-1260
or with a cc to: AFILEH.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil
In the letter your Unit Commander should include rationale for the proposed change. When the proposal relates to an actual situation, the details should be included.

		<question>Am I allowed overseas housing allowance (OHA)?</question>
		<answer>Active Duty:
You are eligible for OHA if you are permanently assigned to an OCONUS permanent duty station (aside from Alaska or Hawaii). Your OHA is effective once you occupy private sector housing and provide proof of housing (i.e. a lease or rental agreement) to your servicing Finance Office.

Reserve:

		<question>Does terminal leave have to follow permissive TDY when taking leave in conjunction with separation or retirement?</question>
		<answer>Yes, terminal leave is used after any permissive TDY is used/charged. Permissive TDY can be taken either in conjunction with terminal leave or any other time before terminal leave starts. You must schedule terminal leave so that it is continuous and ends on the date of separation. Your date of separation must be the last day of terminal leave.</answer>

		<question>Do I need a non-availablilty statement to lodge off-base when TDY to a military installation?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members:
A non-availability statement is not required when the Approving Official (AO) determines that government quarters use would adversely affect mission performance. Your orders must state that government quarters are not directed, if not, then you will need to provide a statement of certification on your voucher to confirm that you in fact checked in with the Base Lodging Facility at your TDY location, and no lodging was available. Additionally, if your TDY is only for 1 night, then government quarters are considered not available (no non-availability statement required).
Civilian Employees:
You are not required to occupy government quarters. Ordinarily, you should lodge at the TDY location. If, for personal preference or convenience, you obtain lodging outside of the area covered by the TDY location you are limited to the lodging rate at the TDY location. If lodgings are not available at the TDY location, then your AO may approve lodging for a higher adjacent locality.

To file your settlement travel voucher, please use Defense Travel System (DTS).
To file your non-DTS settlement travel voucher, please use eFinance.

		<question>Where did my tax free leave go?</question>
		<answer>Tax free leave is charged ahead of all other accrued leave, regardless of when the tax free leave was accrued. In other words, it's 'last in, first out'.  For example, let's assume that you were in a combat zone for 6 months and accrued 15 days of tax free leave. The month following your return from deployment you took 10 days of leave.  By doing so, you reduced your tax free leave balance from 15 to five days.   </answer>

		<question>Why didn't I get paid full per diem rate for my meals?</question>
		<answer>The most probable reason you didn't receive full per diem for your meals is because your travel orders did not authorize you to receive full per diem. Your travel orders should direct the meal rate you receive at your TDY location. There are three options:  all meals available and directed (government meal rate), some meals available and directed (proportional meal rate), and no meals available (full per diem). If your orders are silent, i.e., there is no meals statement specified, the default rate is full per diem.
Your orders Approving Official (AO) has the authority to increase the meal rate but not decrease the per diem rate after return. The AO will simply annotate your orders upon your return if your meals statement was increased during your travel.
If you are in a deployed or contingency environment in support of a Joint Task Force (JTF) and missed meals due to work conflicts, you will need to prepare an AF Form 2282 (Statement of Adverse Effects) to claim the missed meals. The AF Form 2282 will need to be signed by the deployed commander or designee.
If you submitted all the correct documentation with your travel voucher and your orders reflected the full meal rate and you still did not receive the proper per diem, contact your servicing Finance Office

		<answer>All MIHA payments are one-time payments.
There are three types of authorized MIHA that may apply to you:

MIHA/Miscellaneous is based on your locality; if you are authorized overseas housing allowance (OHA), you are authorized MIHA/Miscellaneous. To calculate your MIHA rate for your locality, please click OHA Rates.

MIHA/Rent is an actual expense component that covers reasonable rent-related expenses and must be authorized/approved by a designated official. You must provide receipts for individual expenses of $75 or more.

MIHA/Security is paid if you are assigned to an area where dwellings must be modified to minimize exposure to terrorist and/or criminal threat. See JTR Appendix N (Move-In Housing Allowance - MIHA) for a list of designated locations.

		<question>Does taking leave impact my entitlement to OCONUS Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)?</question>
		<answer>With Dependents:
If you have command-sponsored dependents you are authorized COLA based on the number of dependents with you at the PDS (maximum of 5 dependents) except:
When you and all dependents are away from your OCONUS permanent duty station (PDS) for more than 30 days.
When one or more, or all, dependents departs your OCONUS PDS for more than 30 consecutive calendar days, the COLA payment beginning on the 31st day is reduced to the rate based on the number of dependents remaining at the PDS.
When one or more dependents depart the PDS to attend school, the COLA payable is reduced the day following the departure day to the rate based on the number of dependents remaining at the PDS.
When one or more (but not all) dependents depart the PDS vicinity and early/advance-return to a location other than the OCONUS PDS, the COLA payment is reduced the day following the dependents departure to the rate based on the number of dependents remaining. If all the dependents early/advance-return to another location, then you revert to the single rate of COLA beginning the day the dependents depart your OCONUS PDS.

Without Dependents:
When you're receiving COLA at the without dependent rate, if you  take leave away from your OCONUS PDS, COLA continues for the first 30 days and stops on day 31.  It will resume beginning the day you return to your OCONUS PDS.
To make changes to your COLA, please use eFinance.
Reservists: Please contact your servicing Finance Office to make changes to your COLA.

		<question>Why weren't my taxes adjusted when I took my tax free leave?</question>
		<answer>If the combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) was not posted to your military pay account until after your return, the leave you earned in the CZTE area may not have been posted as special leave yet. As a result, you did not receive the tax free benefit of that leave. When the CZTE is posted to your account, your leave will be adjusted retroactively.

		<question>What is my Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) based on?</question>
		<answer>Two surveys are conducted to determine the COLA rate for overseas locations. One is a Living Pattern Survey given every three years to active duty and reserve members with command-sponsored dependents asking for the percentage of items purchased off-base versus on-base. The second survey is an annual Market Basket Survey that compares prices of goods and services at each location

Your COLA rate is based on your location, grade, and number of command-sponsored dependents (maximum of five dependents). If you reside in dorms, you receive a reduced rate. For your specific COLA rate see the link OCONUS COLA Rates.

For Reservists, you are allowed COLA if you are on duty for more than 30 days. Your rate will be based on your home address and not your duty location. For your specific COLA rate see the link CONUS COLA Rates.

		<question>What is Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA)?</question>
		<answer>You must agree or disagree to receive WTA upon filing for your PCS allowances.  WTA is an estimated partial payment of the final Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) payment designed to cover taxes from your PDT moving expense reimbursement.  It is intended to provide an immediate offset to the tax withheld on the payment and is also subject to withholding.  The WTA is part one of two parts and is paid with the voucher, reimbursing a majority of the Federal tax deducted from the payment.
WTA is calculated at 38.89% of the taxable amount. This is so it will cover not only the 25% one time tax of the allowance, but also the 25% tax on itself.

		<question>How much is the exemption when taking tax free leave?</question>
		<answer>For enlisted personnel, for each day of tax free leave that you take after departing from the combat zone, your monthly taxable wages will be reduced by one day's pay. For example, if you take five days of tax free leave in a month when you are not entitled to the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE), only 25 days of pay will be taxable.  The term pay refers to the pay and allowances that are normally subject to income tax withholding such as basic pay, and incentive and special pays. 
If you are an officer using tax free leave, your limit on the amount of wages that will be exempted is equal to the maximum enlisted amount for the month in which you earned the leave, minus the amount of wages already excluded for that month.  To determine the maximum enlisted amount, add the highest rate of basic pay payable to the highest enlisted grade and the amount of imminent danger pay payable to the officer.  As a practical matter, the benefit of tax free leave for officers may be limited because of this limit on the amount of tax exemption authorized.

		<question>Why does my LES indicate that I am getting Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) for 9 dependents when I live in the dorm?</question>
		<answer>The "9" in the "Depns" box on your LES represents dormitory rate (reduced rate) COLA in the military pay system. Since you reside in the dormitory, and have a government dining facility available, you are entitled to 63% of the without-dependent rate COLA for your rank that would be received if you were residing off base.
To make changes to your COLA, please use eFinance.

		<question>When does my tax free leave expire?</question>
		<answer>Leave earned in a Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE), commonly referred to Tax Free Leave does not expire, and will remain available until used or sold at separation/retirement or for Reserve members upon release from duty with no immediate follow on tour, i.e. no break between orders.
NOTE: CZTE leave is the first leave charged when leave is taken and if CZTE leave is taken during the same month you were in a CZTE zone,CZTE leave does not accrue for that period of time. CZTE leave does not accrue for officers (typically O-4 and above) when your tax exempt pay exceeds the CMSAF pay ceiling.

		<question>How is my leave sell back computed when I separate?</question>
		<answer>Your leave sell back is computed by multiplying the number of leave days you have left at the time you separate by your daily base pay. Your daily base pay is calculated by dividing your monthly base pay by 30.
Federal Taxes are withheld at the "lump sum" payment rate of 25%. Depending on your state tax laws, state taxes may also be withheld.
Selling leave earned in a Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) area will not be taxed.

		<question>How does leave get deducted and does it come from my taxable or non-taxable leave balance?</question>
		<answer>Generally, leave is charged (deducted from your account) with the oldest leave accrued being charged first.  However, tax free leave is an exception.  It is always charged ahead of all other leave regardless of when the tax free leave was accrued. This is also known as 'last in, first out'. </answer>

		<question>Why do I need to file a final settlement voucher if I was reimbursed for everything on my monthly accrual?</question>
		<answer>The monthly accruals that you received are simply advances of any expenses incurred while you were on your TDY. A final settlement voucher is required to be filed upon your return to reconcile the advances and close out your travel order. Your final settlement voucher will need to begin the day you departed for your TDY and end the day you returned in order to offset any advances received.

Accruals require no receipts since they are just advance payments. However, all receipts must be turned in with your final settlement voucher.

Failure to file your final settlement voucher when you have received accrual payments will result in a travel debt.
To file an accrual voucher, please use eFinance.

		<question>As a Cadet, why do I have a debt?</question>
		<answer>Debts can be caused by one of the following:

Overpayment - Debts are generated if your travel voucher was overpaid (to include both cadet travel or travel prior to cadet status).  If you came into the Cadet Wing with a debt caused by overpayment of pay and allowances from Prep-School or Active Duty (usually a result of excess leave) you will also have a debt on your cadet pay account.

Advance Pay - Your initial purchases as a cadet, e.g. uniforms and computer, are paid as an advance from your pay account.  A debt is established for the repayment.  This debt type is prorated and no debt letter will be created.

Exceeding Monthly Base Pay - When a cadet's expenses exceed their monthly pay, debts are created.  In these situations, a suspense is created by the pay system and the debt is collected as money becomes available. A debt letter is not created.

		<question>How much is the per diem rate for a military PCS?</question>
		<answer>Your per diem rate will depend on your method of travel. If you are driving you will receive the standard CONUS rate, in full day increments, for all authorized travel days. If you are using commercial transportation, your per diem rate will be based on your destination or authorized stop-over point. First and last days of commercial travel will be paid at 75% if they do not follow or proceed driving days.

Your dependents will receive a percentage of your per diem allowance. Your spouse and children 12 and over will receive three fourths of your allowance while your children under 12 will receive one half. If your dependents travel separately from you, your spouse, or a designated child over 12 will receive per diem equal to what you would have received for the same travel.

You can find per diem rates at the Per Diem Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee web site at Per Diem Rates.

		<answer>Roth contributions are made from your after-tax income, as opposed to regular TSP contributions which are made from your pre-tax income. When you withdraw funds from your Roth TSP balance, your withdrawal will not be taxed, including the earnings on your contributions. Roth contributions may be beneficial to participants who expect to be in a higher tax bracket when they begin to withdraw their Roth TSP contributions in later years.

		<question>How many travel days am I authorized to my new PDS?</question>
		<answer>The number of travel days you are authorized to reach your new PDS varies depending on your mode of travel:
Privately Owned Vehicle (POV):
If you are driving, you will be authorized one (1) travel day for every 350 miles you drive of the authorized distance. Any remainder of 1-349 miles constitutes an additional travel day.
Example:
Official distance is 1 to 350 miles = one (1) travel day
Official distance is 351 miles = two (2) travel days (if you drive 351 miles in one day, you are still authorized two travel days).
Any additional travel days beyond the allowable travel time will be charged as leave.
Flying CONUS to CONUS:
If you are flying within CONUS, you are authorized one (1) travel day.
Flying OCONUS to CONUS / CONUS to OCONUS:
If you are flying to/from OCONUS, you are authorized actual time traveled. However, if you travel to/from a leave location during this time, you must deduct the time spent traveling to/from the leave location from the total travel days. You also must deduct any travel days that occurred as a result of unauthorized delays enroute.

		<question>When do I need to file my Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) claim?</question>
		<answer>RITA claims should be filed no later than 120 days after the calendar year in which you received your PCS reimbursement.
For example, if you file your PCS voucher between January-December of 2009, you will file your RITA claim in January-April of 2010.
If you file two PCS vouchers in two different calendar years - the first in December 2009, the second in January 2010- then you will file two RITA claims, the first in January-April 2010 and the second in January-April 2011.
Remember that any RITA payment you receive is taxable income and must be reflected on your tax return, i.e., RITA payment received in 2010 is taxable income for 2010 and must be claimed on your 2010 tax return.

If you received a Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA), then you are required to file a RITA claim. If you fail to file by April 30 of the year following your WTA payment, then you must repay ALL of the WTA you received.

		<question>Am I authorized to drive to the schoolhouse for my TDY?</question>
		<answer>Your orders will indicate whether or not it is more advantageous to the government for you to drive to your TDY.
Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) travel as More Advantageous to the Government:
If POC travel is deemed more advantageous to the government and is approved on your orders, you will be reimbursed mileage, as well as per diem up to the authorized number of travel days. POC travel is considered more advantageous to the government for TDY to locations within 800 miles of the PDS (round trip) as determined from the Defense Table of Offical Distances (DTOD).
Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) travel Not More Advantageous to the Government:
You are limited to the constructive travel time for travel by common carrier (i.e. commercial air), usually 1 day each way, for travel to and from the TDY location; excess time is charged as leave. However, for funded TDYs 16 days or more, Air Force policy allows permissive travel time (not chargeable as leave & no per diem payable) for the number of travel days as calculated above.

		<question>What is my Family Separation Housing (FSH) rate while receiving with-dependent rate Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)?</question>
		<answer>FSH-Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) based location (FSH-O) and FSH-BAH based location (FSH-B) is computed the same as 'without dependent' OHA/BAH.
If you are assigned to an unaccompanied OCONUS PDS and are required to reside off base, then you will be entitled to FSH-O.
If assigned to an unaccompanied tour in Alaska or Hawaii and are required to reside off base, then you will be entitled to FSH-B.

You will continue to receive BAH for your dependents residing in the CONUS provided they are not assigned adequate government quarters.

		<question>Why do I have to recertify my Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)?</question>
		<answer>The law requires everyone who receives BAH on behalf of their dependents, to submit a certification to the Finance Office. The certification is completed by filling out an AF Form 594 (Application and Authorization to start, stop or change BAQ or Dependency Re-determination). The certification must indicate the status of each dependent to the military sponsor. You are required to review and recertify information concerning your allowance to BAH at PCS arrival, every four years (for those who have not completed a PCS in that period of time), and within 60 days prior to separation or retirement.
To recertify your BAH in conjunction with PCS, please use PCS In-Processing System (PIPS).
Otherwise, please use eFinance to recertify your BAH.

		<question>If I have a Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC), then can I get a TDY advance?</question>
		<answer>Generally, you cannot get a TDY advance off your TDY orders. You can obtain a cash advance from an ATM with your GTCC, but not earlier than 3 duty days before your first scheduled travel day.
If you do not have a GTCC, or your TDY location will not allow GTCC use, then you may go to your Finance Office and request an advance paid by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). You will be required to supply your travel order with the advance authorized on it or an authorization letter for the amount requested. The authorization letter must be signed by your Commander or First Sergeant.
Please use eFinance to process your travel advance request.

		<question>What am I allowed to receive for my TDY travel advance?</question>
		<answer>You are generally allowed to receive 80 percent of your per diem, lodging, transportation costs and other out of pocket expenses as well as 100 percent of any registration fees three duty days before departure.
If the 80 percent limitation will cause undue hardship, then you can request approval from your orders approving official for the additional 20 percent.
A TDY travel advance is only authorized if you are exempted from having a Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC). The advance will be paid by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Reference the DODFMR Vol 9 Chap 3 (DoD Government Travel Charge Card) for further guidance.

		<question>How is my leave charged?</question>
		<answer>Your leave is charged based on your status when you depart on leave and your status when you return off leave. Simply put, if you depart on leave on a non-duty day (the weekend for most), the day you depart on leave is chargeable and if you return off of leave on a non-duty day, the day you return is not chargeable.
NOTE: This is a recent change of Air Force policy, which is directly opposite of what was the previous policy was for chargeable leave. It does not change the number of days chargeable, just the way leave days are charged.

		<question>If I marry enroute, will my spouse be authorized reimbursement?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members:
It depends on the effective date of your PCS orders. The effective date of orders is your arrival date at your new PDS minus your authorized travel days plus one day. If you were married prior to that date you would be authorized dependent travel. You will need to have your PCS orders amended to include the new dependent. If you were married after that date there would be no allowance for dependent travel.
You can file your PCS voucher by clicking on the PIPS link below.
Civilian Employees:
You are authorized dependent travel allowances for Permanent Duty Travel (PDT) if you acquire dependents prior to/at the time you report for duty at your new PDS. Dependent travel authorization must be included on your travel orders.

		<question>I just completed Inactive Duty Training (IDT)/Unit Training Assembly (UTA). Why was I paid only Points?</question>
		<answer>The pay system will default to "points only" once you have reached your maximum periods which are authorized for pay. You are authorized a maximum of 24 or 48 drills, depending on your reserve category, for pay in a fiscal year.
Some IMA categories are required to work a maximum of 24 drills.
If you wish to receive more points towards retirement, then you may perform IDT/UTA without pay and receive points only. Contact your Commander's Support Staff (CSS) for approval of points without pay duty.

		<question>What effect will a bonus recoupment have on my taxes?</question>
		<answer>Provided your bonus was taxable to begin with (i.e. not subject to combat zone tax exclusion - CZTE), your current month taxable wages will be reduced by the amount of collection in the current month.
Keep in mind, a bonus recoupment is based off your gross bonus, before taxes are deducted. Since your current income is reduced for a bonus recoupment, your overall taxable wages for the year will also be reduced, which may lower your tax liability for the tax year. See a tax professional for more details.

		<question>Can I send a dependent home early?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members: Yes, if dependent(s) are command sponsored they may be returned early for the following reasons:
Official situations ( JTR Chap 5 Part A Para 5098 (Uniformed Members - Early Return of Dependents - Official Situations))
National interest ( JTR Chap 5 Part A Para 5100 (Uniformed Members - Early Return of Dependents - National Interest))
Personal situations ( JTR Chap 5 Part A Para 5102 (Uniformed Members - Early Return of Dependents - Personal OCONUS Situations))
Civilian Employees: Early return travel may be authorized when:
An employee is eligible for return transportation after completing the PDS service period agreement; or
The OCONUS command determines that it is in the GOV’T’s best interest to return the dependent for reasons of a humanitarian/compassionate nature.

		<question>What allowances do I get or lose if my dependents leave under early return of dependents (ERD) orders?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members: An Early Return of Dependents (ERD) can affect both travel and military pay allowances depending on the reasons your dependents are returning.  

The most common changes to your military pay will be Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) and Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) adjustments.  Your COLA will be reduced based on the number of dependents leaving the OCONUS area.  If all of your dependents leave, you will receive the single rate of COLA for your grade.  Your OHA will also change.  
Since your dependents will now be at a designated CONUS location, you will be authorized Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on their location. You can not receive both BAH and OHA. You may be entitled to a special Family Separation Allowance for Housing-Overseas housing allowance (FSH-O) that is based on the single rate of OHA, provided single-type government quarters are not available.

Your dependents will generally be authorized PCS travel allowances from the OCONUS PDS to a designated place in the CONUS. Household Goods shipment may be authorized as well.  

Your specific circumstances determine your actual allowances.  See the regulations below for more detailed information.
Civilian Employees: Once dependents travel on ERD orders certain limitations apply
A dependent’s early return travel must not be authorized more than once during each agreed period of OCONUS service.
A dependent’s return travel at GOV’T expense to the OCONUS PDS is not authorized except when incident to the employee’s Renewal Agreement Travel (RAT).
A dependent’s early return transportation expenses to the OCONUS PDS are reimbursable when an employee:

Completes an agreed to period of service,
Has received unaccompanied one-way dependent transportation to the actual residence, and
Has RAT at a later date.
Reimbursement must not exceed the GOV’T's cost for the usual transportation mode and route that would have been used had the dependent traveled back to the OCONUS PDS with the employee.

		<question>How do I correct an error in the contributions to my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account?</question>
		<answer>If you have an error or discrepancy regarding your TSP withholdings, you must notify your servicing Finance Office within one year of notification of the discrepancy.  Since TSP transactions are reflected on your leave and earnings statement (LES), your notification of a discrepancy happens when the transaction either isn't reflected on your LES or is reflected incorrectly. Your Finance Office can determine if you are making a claim to request correction of an agency error or an administrative error. If your Finance Office determines that the discrepancy is due to an agency error, they will assist you in completing a DD Form 2851 (Request to Correct TSP Agency Error) and forward your claim to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).  

The following are examples of agency errors for which a claim may be appropriate:
You enrolled in TSP and deductions were not withheld, a different percentage amount than the amount you specified was withheld, or the deduction was taken from a different category of pay than what you elected.
Your statement from the National Finance Center (NFC) does not properly reflect the amounted contributed to your account.
You elected to stop your TSP contributions but the deductions continued beyond the first full pay period after the Finance Office received your form.
DFAS will adjudicate the DD Form 2851 (Request to Correct TSP Agency Error) within approximately 30 days of its receipt and notify you and your Finance Office of the results.

		<question>If I did not submit my Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) claim at my last base, can I file it at my new base?</question>
		<answer>Since TLA requires approval from the base Housing Office, every attempt should be made to submit your final TLA claim at your losing base prior to departing.  On rare occasions, when the final TLA claim cannot be submitted before your departure, your losing base will need to submit all information required (including the reason the TLA could not be processed prior to your departure) to your gaining base.  This will allow your TLA claim to be processed at your new PDS.</answer>

		<question>Why am I still paying taxes when I'm tax exempt?</question>
		<answer>Check your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) to confirm that federal taxes are being deducted from your pay. If so, and a check of DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 44 (Withholding of Income Tax) verifies that you are in a designated combat zone, contact your deployed Finance representative.  He/she will work with your Finance Office to update your pay account with the combat zone exemption.
If you are a commissioned officer and your monthly pay exceeds the maximum exemption, taxes will be withheld on the amount that exceeds the exemption.  Your maximum exemption is equal to the sum of the highest rate of enlisted basic pay plus the amount of Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) payable to you during a qualifying month.

		<answer>The normal maximum leave carryover allowed is 60 days.  However, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013 temporarily changed the maximum carryover from 60 days to 75 days.  The current leave extension period will end on 30 September 2015.  Unless the NDAA is modified, leave in excess of 60 days on 1 October 2015 will be lost.

That means that members who carried forward a leave balance of 75 days on October 1, 2014, will have to use 45 days of leave before 30 September 2015 in order to prevent losing leave (45 days is derived from (a.) 30 days are accrued during the year, and (b.) the 15 days of extra leave). Barring any additional changes to the law or policy on the subject, if your leave balance exceeds 60 days on 1 October 2015, the balance will be reduced, resulting in a new balance of 60 days.



Also, please note, this change does not affect leave accrued under special leave accrual (SLA) for a deployment or similar circumstances.

		<question>Which retired pay actions can I take care of at the local base?</question>
		<answer>Your local Finance Office typically has limited access to process retired pay transactions and strongly encourages the use of myPay.

If you do not currently have a myPay account you can request a pin online or with the help of your local Finance Office.  Your local Finance Office can also assist you with preparing and forwarding some pay-related documents to DFAS-Cleveland. DFAS-Cleveland is responsible for all retired pay transactions and inquiries.

You may contact DFAS-Cleveland at 1-800-321-1080 or 216-522-5955.

		<question>Half of my allotment came out of my mid-month pay, but the bank didn't receive it. Why?</question>
		<answer>DFAS only disburses allotments once per month. Although funds are withheld from your pay twice per month, the disbursement to the bank or receiving institution takes place at the end of the month (paid on the 1st of the following month). The allotment is collected evenly from both pay periods to minimize fluctuations in the amount of pay you receive.
For example, if you have an allotment of $100 per month to a bank, then your two paychecks for the month will each show a deduction of $50. After the second $50 is deducted from your end of month paycheck (for a total monthly deduction of $100), the full $100 payment is made to the bank on the 1st of the following month.
Most allotments can be set up through myPay.
Home Mortgage and Insurance allotments must be completed through eFinance or at your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>What is the allotments process?</question>
		<answer>Allotments allow you to send money to a financial institution directly from your paycheck. Each month, half of the allotment amount is deducted from your mid-month paycheck and the other half from your end of month paycheck. The system pays out the total allotment amount to the financial institution on the first day of the following month.
You may have up to 15 allotments at one single time, with up to 6 of these being discretionary.  Discretionary allotments include allotments for dependent support, savings, insurance and home mortgage payments. Non-discretionary allotments include allotments for the purchase of U.S. savings bonds through the Treasury Direct Website.
Most discretionary allotments can be set up through myPay and are disbursed via electronic funds transfer (EFT) to your financial institution.
Home Mortgage and Insurance allotments must be completed through eFinance or at your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>If we are already in the current month, can I stop my allotment so that it does not apply to my Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) for this month?</question>
		<answer>Yes, stops may be effective either at the end of the prior processing month or at the end of the current processing month. However, if you wish for your allotment to stop in the current month, you must ensure it is stopped prior to the end of month cutoff. End of month cutoff varies slightly but usually falls around the 20th of each month.
Most allotments can be stopped through myPay.  Home mortgage, privatized housing or insurance allotments must be stopped through eFinance or at your servicing Finance Office.
NOTE: Generally, military pay documents received by your Finance Office by the 1st of the month will be reflected in your mid-month pay and documents received after the 1st and before the 16th of the month normally will be reflected in your end-of-month pay.

		<question>Why didn't I get reimbursed for my lodging on my voucher?</question>
		<answer>There are multiple reasons why your lodging might not have been reimbursed:
You did not submit a lodging receipt with your voucher
The lodging receipt you submitted was not itemized with daily charges
You did not claim the lodging on your voucher
You did not provide a "non-availability" statement or confirmation number from your TDY Billeting Office
If you provided all the necessary documentation and still not get reimbursed for your lodging, contact your servicing Finance Office.
If you did not provide all the proper documentation, you will need to file a supplemental travel voucher for reimbursement.  contact your servicing Finance Office for procedures on filing a supplemental voucher.

		<question>Why can't I have multiple allotments going to the same bank?</question>
		<answer>To minimize the cost to the Government in the administration of the allotment system, only one allotment may be sent to an allottee. If you wish to send multiple amounts to the same allottee, or the same financial institution, it is your responsibility to work with the institution to transfer funds between the accounts at the institution. Only one allotment for the total may be established.
Most allotments can be set up through myPay.
Bond (stop only), Home Mortgage, and Insurance allotments must be completed through eFinance or at your servicing Finance Office.

		<question>Is the leave I sell back taxable?</question>
		<answer>Yes, when you sell back leave, it is considered part of your basic pay and is therefore taxable income.  Federal tax withholding is calculated at 25% of your total entitlement; in addition, most states withhold income tax at a one-time rate.
If part of the leave sold is combat zone exempt leave (leave earned while eligible for Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE)), that leave will not be taxed for enlisted members (for rules regarding taxing for Officers see DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 35 Para 350103.B.2.

		<question>If I have a break in service, will my clothing allowance start over?</question>
		<answer>If you have less than a three month break in service, your clothing allowance will not restart. It will continue to be paid on your normal anniversary date. 
If you have more than a three month long break in service, your clothing allowance will start over and a new anniversary date will be established based upon your new active duty entry date.
Active Duty:
If you have more than a three month long break in service, you are authorized a new, full initial clothing allowance.
Reserve:
If you have more than a three month long break in service, your clothing allowance will start over, provided that you are going on active duty for more than six months and for a reason other than active duty for training. The amount you are entitled to is the value of the initial clothing allowance at the time you resume service minus the current value of the clothing you had when you commenced your pause in service.
For example, if the initial clothing allowance at the time you resume service is $300, and the current value of the clothing you had leftover from when you paused your service is $100, you would be authorized $200.  
Detailed instructions can be found in the DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 29 Para 290202 (Standard Initial Clothing Allowance - Entitlement Criteria), AFMAN 65-116 Vol 1 Chap 33 (Clothing Allowances) and AFMAN 65-116 Vol 3 Chap 15 (Reserve Component: Clothing and Uniform Allowances).

		<question>How do I get maternity clothing allowance?</question>
		<answer>Active Duty:
Maternity clothing allowance is processed on an AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report.  The AF 469 is initiated at your Military Treatment Facility and must be signed by either your physician or health care practitioner.  The form is then presented to your CSS, where your commander or First Sergeant endorses it.  Prior to endorsement, your commander or First Sergeant must counsel you on requirements to purchase mandatory uniform items and must place a statement on the AF 469 stating that you have been counseled.  After your commander or First Sergeant endorses the AF 469, submit it to your local Finance Office for processing.  Once processed, your allowance will flow into your next available paycheck.
You may not receive maternity clothing allowance more than once in a three year period.
Reserve:
Your commander must require and authorize the uniform.  When your commander authorizes the maternity uniform, you will be directed to your medical treatment facility where an AF Form 422 will be prepared.  You should then take the AF 422 to your local Pay Office, who will add the commander's certification and approve the form.  Once the form is approved, your maternity clothing can be issued to you in-kind.

		<question>How much is my reenlistment bonus taxed?</question>
		<answer>Bonus payments are subject to federal and state taxation.  Your reenlistment bonus will be taxed at the flat Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW) rate (currently 25%) plus any State Income Tax Withholding (SITW) rate applicable to the state you claim for tax purposes.

If you reenlisted during a month when you were authorized Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) then your bonus and future installments will not be taxed.  Also, if you had your bonus paid directly to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), it will not be taxed until you withdraw the money.

		<answer>Once you are fully accessed (your pay record is established), you will be paid on the 1st and 15th of each month. If there are delays in the establishment of your record, then you may be able to receive partial payments from your servicing local Finance Office until your pay record is fully accessed.
Your pay is determined by the length of your service time, tax rates, the number of dependents you have, and numerous other factors. To find out about your specific pay, contact your servicing Finance Office.
All payments are made through electronic funds transfer (EFT) to your direct deposit account. You are required to establish direct deposit of your pay to your financial institution as part of accession in-processing. In an emergency situation, your servicing Finance Office may make a local payment for accrued pay and allowances, if your direct deposit has not started yet.

		<question>How much Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) am I allowed during an active duty tour that is more than 30 days?</question>
		<answer>If you have been called or ordered to active duty for more than 30 days, you are authorized to receive BAH/OHA per the following:
Active duty tours between 31 and 139 days receive BAH/OHA at the primary residence rate
Active duty tours of 140 or more days and authorized to ship HHG receive BAH/OHA at the duty location rate
Active duty tours of 140 or more days and not authorized to ship HHG receive BAH/OHA at the primary residence rate
Active duty tours of 180 or more days FOR OTHER THAN TRAINING and authorized to ship HHG receive BAH/OHA at the duty location rate
Active duty tours of 180 or more days FOR OTHER THAN TRAINING and not authorized to ship HHG receive BAH/OHA at the primary residence rate

Your BAH is determined by your grade, dependency status, and home of record. See BAH Rates to find your current rate .
Please contact your servicing Finance Office if you believe you are receiving the incorrect BAH rate.

		<question>How often do I get my accruals?</question>
		<answer>You begin receiving accrual payments 30 days from the first day of the TDY, and every 30 days thereafter until you return to your Permanent Duty Station (PDS). TDY period must be over 45 days for you to file an accrual.
An exception to this payment schedule is when airline tickets are charged to your Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC). They may be paid upon your request if the split disbursement option is used, but not earlier than your departure.
If you do not receive accrual payments, you can go into virtual MPF and make a request for payment. See AFI 65-114 Chap 9.4.7 (Accrual Payments for TDYs over 45 days) for more information.
If the order was established in the Defense Travel System (DTS) and you requested accruals, they are paid automatically every 30 days.

		<question>How much total per diem am I authorized for PCS travel?</question>
		<answer>You are authorized to 100% of the applicable per diem rate, which includes Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) and Lodging multiplied by the number of actual travel days not to exceed the authorized travel days. Your spouse and each child 12 or over are authorized 75% of your allowance, and each child under 12 is authorized 50% of your allowance.
If you drive, the per diem rate is the standard CONUS rate.
For other modes of travel, the rate is generally based on the rate for your destination. In such situations, the first and last travel day per diems are also reduced from 100% to 75% of the applicable per diem.
You can go to the website below for current per diem rates. You can file your PCS voucher by clicking on the PIPS link below.

		<question>How much federal tax and state tax will be taken out of my reenlistment bonus?</question>
		<answer>Bonus payments are subject to federal and state taxation.  Your reenlistment bonus will be taxed at the flat Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW) rate (currently 25%) plus any State Income Tax Withholding (SITW) applicable to the state you claim for tax purposes.

If you reenlisted during a month when you were entitled to Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) then your bonus and future installments will not be taxed.  Also, if you had your bonus paid directly to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), it will not be taxed until you withdraw the money.

		<question>What is Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE)?</question>
		<answer>The combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) allows military personnel to exclude from tax liability all or a portion of their pay and entitlements earned while serving in designated combat zones (CZ). A CZ is any area designated by Executive Order as an area in which Armed Forces of the United States are, or have, engaged in combat. The exclusion is applied monthly for any month in which you served in a designated CZ.
For enlisted personnel and warrant officers, all pay is exempt from taxes. For officers, the amount excluded from taxes is limited to the sum of the highest rate of enlisted basic pay plus the amount of Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) actually payable to the officer for the qualifying month.

CZTE applies to withholding for both federal and state income tax. However, your basic pay remains subject to withholding for Social Security and Medicare taxes.   
If you are hospitalized, or rehospitalized, because of a wound, disease or injury that you incurred while serving in a combat zone, your tax free status (CZTE) continues while you are hospitalized.  Your exclusion ends when you are discharged from the hospital or changed to outpatient status.  If you are rehospitalized due to the same injury you may also qualify for the tax exclusion for up to two years after hostilities have ended. Reference DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 44 Para 440103C7 link below and the Wounded Warrior Handbook, published by DFAS.  There are additional support materials on the DFAS Wounded Warrior website.

		<question>Does my travel pay have to go to my military pay account?</question>
		<answer>No, your travel pay does not have to go to your military pay account. You can designate a separate account at any time. To designate your travel pay account, for non-DTS vouchers, you will need to complete an Standard Form 1199A (Direct Deposit Sign-Up) or an FMS Form 2231 (Instructions for Processing Federal Employee Payments) and turn it into your local Finance Office. Make sure you specify "Travel Only" clearly on the form so that your military pay does not get changed by mistake.
Once you change your travel account, it will remain that way until you either change it again or PCS. It will not update automatically when you change your direct deposit for your military pay and will not follow you to your next base when you PCS. If your travel payment rejects, the AFFSC will use your military pay account to resend the funds.
DTS - If you need to change your banking information in DTS, please contact your unit point of contact for DTS, also known as the Organizational Defense Travel Administrator (ODTA). Alternatively, you can update your banking information when you create a new travel authorization in DTS.

		<question>Can I use Virtual Military Personnel Flight (vMPF) to file my accrual payment for my TDY?</question>
		<answer>Yes, as long as your TDY/Deployment orders are greater than 45 days, vMPF still remains the preferred method for a traveling member to process an accrual payment.
You may also fax a copy of the accrual worksheet along with a copy of your orders/receipts to the Finance Office.
Alternatively, you may request an accrual payment by using eFinance.

		<question>How do I get a new password or PIN for my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account?</question>
		<answer>If you have forgotten or lost your TSP account password, you will not be able to access your TSP account or perform account transactions until you obtain a new password.

		<question>How do I start Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)?</question>
		<answer>If you're a new accession your BAH will be started from your in-processing paperwork with the Finance Office.
If you are moving out of housing or the dorms, the Housing Office or dorm manager will prepare the paperwork as you out-process with them.
If you are already receiving BAH but have a change in your dependency status, you must provide proper documentation (i.e., marriage license, divorce decree, birth certificate) to your finance office and complete AF Form 594 (Application and Authorization to start, stop or change BAQ or Dependency Re-determination) so that change can be reflected in your pay.
If you are claiming with dependent BAH base upon Common Law Marriage, you must meet the requirements for state. Contact the Legal Office for more information on state requirements.

		<question>Why did an advance debt appear on my Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)?</question>
		<answer>An advance debt on your LES is generally the result of an overpayment of pay or allowances.  This occurs when a transaction is processed retroactively that changes your entitlement.  Advance debts are usually the result of PCS travel, dependency status changes or deployments.  Please contact your servicing Finance Office for assistance in determining the specific cause of the advance debt.</answer>

		<question>When will my Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate change?</question>
		<answer>There are many circumstances that affect your BAH rate. The most common are:
Change in dependent status:
If you get married or divorced or if your spouse enters active duty or separates
If you are providing child support for a child not in your custody and that is your sole dependent and you move into unaccompanied personnel housing
Birth of a child if you are not married, or death of a spouse with no children involved
Promotion/demotion:
The rate will change automatically when your pay record reflects the new grade; if you are promoted and the BAH rate for the new grade is lower than your previous BAH rate, you will continue to receive the old rate due to BAH Rate Protection.
Moving in or out of Military Family Housing or the dorms
Housing or the dorm manager will prepare the AF Form 594 (Application and Authorization to start, stop or change BAQ or Dependency Re-determination) to stop or start your entitlement as appropriate
Relocation for a PCS:
Your BAH will continue at your old rate until sign in to your new duty station in most cases.

		<question>Do I put my leave days in LeaveWeb before I depart on my TDY or PCS?</question>
		<answer>No, for RTS generated travel you do not put your TDY or PCS leave in LeaveWeb.  Leave taken during TDY and PCS is accounted for on your RTS travel voucher.  The only time you will put your leave in LeaveWeb during a TDY yourself is if you are taking leave in the middle of your TDY and not en route while traveling.  Due to the method in which leave days are calculated from a travel voucher, the actual days of leave charged may not match the days you took, however, the total number of days will still be correct.  For DTS generated travel you will put your leave days in LeaveWeb or in your time and attendance reporting system for civilians.</answer>

		<question>What am I allowed for my dependent student going to school in CONUS or at a Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) school overseas?</question>
		<answer>OCONUS School
If your permanent duty station is OCONUS, then your dependent is authorized one round-trip between the school and your OCONUS permanent duty station, per fiscal year (1 October - 30 September). The allowance is for transportation only unless lodging is necessary due to an interruption in travel caused by extraordinary circumstances.

The transportation must be arranged through Air Mobility Command (AMC) service, if reasonably available. If AMC service is not reasonably available, then government procured transportation should be used, through the Contract Travel Office (CTO) and/or the Travel Management Center (TMC).

If transportation is personally procured and AMC service was available, then reimbursement will not be authorized.
Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA)
Dependents authorized and attending a dormitory DODEA school generally attend a DODEA school on a 5- or 7-day a week dormitory basis; this is available for each eligible minor dependent student of the member.

If your dependent resides in a dormitory 5-days a week, they are allowed weekly round trips between the school and your residence at your current permanent duty station (PDS).

If your dependent resides in a dormitory 7-days a week, they are allowed 3 round trips during the year between the school and your residence at the PDS. Additional trips may be authorized when the school dormitory is closed.

In addition, each eligible minor dependent attending a dormitory DODEA school (or DODEA selected school) is authorized to transport up to 350 pounds of unaccompanied baggage on the first and final trip of the year.
You are allowed transportation only, in the following forms:
government - owned or procured common carrier transportation
self - procured common carrier transportation (limited to government cost)
mileage allowance in lieu of transportation (MALT)
Per diem is not payable.

		<question>Can I ship a privately owned vehicle (POV) in conjunction to a PCS within CONUS?</question>
		<answer>Uniformed Members:
Yes, only when the cost of you and your family driving together in one car is compared to the cost of the you and your family driving separately in two cars. The reimbursement will not exceed the cost the government would have incurred had they arranged the transportation.
Civilian Employees:
Yes, provided it is more advantageous and cost effective to the Government to transport your POV(s) to your new permanent duty station (PDS) at Government expense and to pay for transportation of you and/or your immediate family by commercial means than to have you and/or your immediate family member(s) drive one or more POV(s) to the new PDS.

		<question>How do I request a corrected W-2?</question>
		<answer>In all cases, if you believe that your W-2 needs to be corrected, you'll need to start with your servicing Finance Office. If your request is to correct a W-2 for your military pay or civilian pay, the technician in your Finance Office will forward your request to the appropriate payroll office. If your request relates to travel entitlements (civilian PCS travel or personally procured move allowances (formerly DITY), your Finance Office will help determine any additional information such as receipts or vouchers that you may need to file so that a corrected W-2 can be issued. 

When corrected W-2s (W-2C) are issued for military or civilian pay, the corrected document will be loaded and available on myPay also, where up to five years of statements are available. Corrected W-2s for other entitlements are mailed to you when completed.

		<question>What happens to my pay and allowances if my dependents evacuate?</question>
		<answer>Your Basic Pay and Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) remain the same.
Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) is not affected if you remain at the PDS and continue to maintain private sector housing.
Your Cost Of Living Allowance (COLA) received on behalf of command-sponsored dependents stops effective the date your dependents depart.  Thereafter, until your dependents return to the PDS, you receive “without dependents” rate COLA.
You are entitled to Family Separation Allowance (FSA) beginning the day your command-sponsored dependents leave, continuing for the authorized departure period to a safe haven.  The rate is $250.00 per month.

		<question>How do I change my Serviceman's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) election?</question>
		<answer>Visit your servicing Personnel Office to change your SGLI or Family Serviceman's Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) election. For SGLI forms search for article "1676" in myPers.
Provide a copy of the election form to your servicing RC Payroll Office.
Please note that as of 02 January 2013, military members who marry another military member of the Armed Forces are no longer automatically covered under SGLI. This is due to a change in Public Law.  Previously, members' military spouses were automatically covered for an additional $100,000 or less, depending on the member's election.  Members are now required to submit an election for the additional coverage. For more information about the FSGLI change, including how to elect coverage and premium information, go to myPers and search for article "25004" or for "FSGLI."

		<question>If I am paying child support, can I receive the dependent Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate?</question>
		<answer>Scenario - You reside in single type government quarters:
If you are paying child support, you will be authorized BAH-Differential. The amount of child support must be equal to or greater than the BAH-Differential Rate.
Scenario - You do not reside in single type government quarters:
If you are not residing in government quarters, you will receive the dependent rate.
In both cases the allowance is on the behalf of a dependent solely on the basis of payment of child support. In no case, will you receive greater than the dependent rate allowance. For example, if you get remarried, your spouse becomes the primary dependent and your child support is no longer a factor in the rate. NOTE:  This only applies to single personnel or mil-mil couples with no other qualifying dependents.
