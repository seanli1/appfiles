#Boxpert's simple goal is to quickly tell you how to stack apple boxes to an exact height using the fewest number of boxes.
#
#
#
#INSTRUCTIONS:
#
#1.  Enter the number of apple boxes available.
#
#2.  Choose orientations that work for you. For example, sometimes you want them all to be flat (LA) for best stability. Choose based on your situation.
#
#3.  Select your target height and press the button.
#
#
#That's it! Boxpert tells you exactly what you need to achieve that height. No more fumbling on set.
#
#If an exact match isn’t possible with what you have, you’ll still get the closest solutions.
#
#
#
#* Boxpert is partial to using larger boxes as well as LA orientations, so you get the most stable solution possible.
#
#* Lastly, a pro tip: In certain situations, it can help to subtract an inch and bring wedges. Hope you enjoy!
