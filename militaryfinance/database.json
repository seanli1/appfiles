    "question": "Why is my BAH different from someone at my duty location who has the same rank as I do?",
    "answer": "If you are receiving a different BAH allowance than someone from the same duty location that has the same rank as you, BAH Rate Protection is probably in effect for one of you.  The monthly BAH amount must not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the MHA (Military Housing Area), changes in the national monthly housing cost, or a member's promotion.  One of you is most likely receiving a higher BAH in an area where there was a BAH reduction.  This grandfathering protects the member from BAH fluctuations.\nTo check the rate of BAH for your PDS (Note, BAH is based on your PDS Zip Code, not your home Zip Code) and rank, please visit DTMO's BAH Rates web site.\nHowever, if you believe this is not the case (i.e. the rate in your area did not decrease and you are not subject to BAH Rate Protection), then you should immediately contact your servicing Finance Office to ensure you are not over or under paid.\n",

    "question": "How can I get copies of old travel vouchers?",
    "answer": "For vouchers that were created and processed electronically through the Defense Travel System (DTS), you can view and print your paid travel vouchers by accessing DTS.\nFor non-DTS vouchers such as PCS and most deployment travel, when the voucher is paid, a copy is emailed to you at the address on file in the Reserve Travel System (RTS). If you didn't get a copy, it could be that an incorrect email address is on file in RTS or there could have been a delay in processing your voucher. You should contact your servicing Finance Office for assistance and to check your RTS email address. \nIf you are looking for a voucher filed at a different duty location, you should contact that base for help in retrieving old voucher copies.  You can use our FSO Look-up Tool to find the contact information for the FSO at different locations.\nPlease note that the statute of limitations on travel voucher retention by the FSO is 6 years and 3 months.  It is unlikely you will be able to retrieve voucher copies beyond that time frame, so therefore it is important to always save a digital or hard copy of all filed travel vouchers in your personal records. \n",

Waivers for non-participation in the Direct Deposit of Pay Program may be granted by the unit and/or installation commander. Waivers may be granted upon an individual’s request, or may be commander-directed due to circumstances in which participation in the Direct Deposit of Pay Program is not feasible or practical. A waiver issued by the unit commander at the member’s request may not exceed six months. A waiver of greater than six months must be approved by the unit’s higher headquarters or the installation commander, whichever is applicable. The Direct Deposit of Pay Waiver Report, UH022-302, is sent monthly to each unit to identify non-participation and whether a waiver has been approved and if so, when it expires.",
