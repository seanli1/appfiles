#Use Boxpert to stack apple boxes to a certain height using what you have:
#
#1.  Enter the boxes you have available.
#
#2.  Select orientations that work for you. For example, sometimes you want them all to be flat (LA) for best stability. Choose based on your situation.
#
#3.  Select your target height and press the button.
#
#That's it! Boxpert tells you exactly what boxes you need to achieve that height. No more fumbling on set.
#
#If an exact match isn’t possible with what you have, you’ll still get the closest solutions.
#
#Just order more boxes next time. 😉
